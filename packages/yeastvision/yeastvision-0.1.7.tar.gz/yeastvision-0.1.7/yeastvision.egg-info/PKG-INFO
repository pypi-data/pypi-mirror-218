# <p>  <b>YeastVision </b> </p>


# Installation

## Local installation (< 2 minutes)

### System requirements

This package supports Linux, Windows and Mac OS. Mac Os should be later than Yosemite. This system has been heavily tested on Linux and Mac OS machines, and less thoroughly on Windows. 
 
### Instructions 

If you have an older `yeastvision` environment you should remove it with `conda env remove -n yeastvision` before creating a new one. 

Yeastvision is ready to go for cpu-usage as soon as it downloaded. GPU-usage requires some additional steps after download. To download:

1. Install an [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) distribution of Python. Note you might need to use an anaconda prompt if you did not add anaconda to the path.
2. Open an anaconda prompt / command prompt which has `conda` for **python 3** in the path
3. Create a new environment with `conda create --name yeastvision python=3.10.o`. 
4. Activate this new environment by running `conda activate yeastvision`
5. Run `python -m pip install yeastvision` to download our package plus all dependencies
6. Download the weights [online](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Zl3b00eSbe3wbxpYOknEP5q0A86XtEfL/view?usp=sharing). 
7. Run `install-weights` in the same directory as the *yeastvision_weights.zip* file


You should upgrade yeastvision (package [here](https://pypi.org/project/yeastvision/)) periodically as it is still in development. To do so, run the following in the environment:

~~~sh
python -m pip install yeastvision --upgrade
~~~

### Using YeastVision with Nvidia GPU

Again, enusre your yeastvision conda environment is active for the following commands.

To use your NVIDIA GPU with python, you will first need to install the NVIDIA driver for your GPU, check out this [website](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-us) to download it. Ensure it is downloaded and your GPU is detected by running `nvidia-smi` in the terminal.

Next we need to remove the CPU version of torch:
~~~
pip uninstall torch
~~~

To install the GPU version of torch, follow the instructions [here](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/). The conda install is strongly recommended, and then choose the CUDA version that is supported by your GPU (newer GPUs may need newer CUDA versions > 10.2). For instance this command will install the 11.6 version on Linux and Windows (note the `torchvision` and `torchaudio` commands are removed because yeastvision doesn't require them):
~~~
conda install pytorch pytorch-cuda=11.6 -c pytorch -c nvidia
~~~

If you are unable to install the package using the command above, try an older version like cuda 11.3:
~~~
conda install pytorch==1.12.0 cudatoolkit=11.3 -c pytorch
~~~~
Info on how to install several older versions is available [here](https://pytorch.org/get-started/previous-versions/). 

After install you can check `conda list` for `pytorch`, and its version info should have `cuXX.X`, not `cpu`.

# Run yeastvision locally

The quickest way to start is to open the GUI from a command line terminal. Activate the correct conda environment, then run:
~~~~
yeastvision
~~~~

To get started, drop an image or directory of images into the GUI. 

**Masks can be loaded by dropping them into the top half of the screen.**
