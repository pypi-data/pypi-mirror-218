space_utils

space_utils is a Python library that provides functionality for space-related calculations and conversions. 
It offers convenient methods for gravitational force calculation, 
escape velocity calculation, and orbital period calculation.

Installation:

You can install space_utils using pip

"pip install space_utils"

Usage:

Gravitational Force Calculation:

from space_utils.gravitational_force import calculate_gravitational_force

mass1 = 5.972e24  # Mass of Earth in kilograms
mass2 = 7.348e22  # Mass of Moon in kilograms
distance = 3.844e8  # Distance between Earth and Moon in meters

force = calculate_gravitational_force(mass1, mass2, distance)
print(f"The gravitational force between Earth and Moon is: {force} N")


Escape Velocity Calculation:

from space_utils.escape_velocity import calculate_escape_velocity

mass_earth = 5.972e24  # Mass of Earth in kilograms
radius_earth = 6.371e6  # Radius of Earth in meters

escape_velocity_earth = calculate_escape_velocity(mass_earth, radius_earth)
print(f"The escape velocity of Earth is: {escape_velocity_earth} m/s")

Orbital Period Calculation:

from space_utils.orbital_period import calculate_orbital_period

semimajor_axis = 42164000  # Semimajor axis of the Moon's orbit around Earth in meters
mass_earth = 5.972e24  # Mass of Earth in kilograms
mass_moon = 7.348e22  # Mass of Moon in kilograms

orbital_period_moon = calculate_orbital_period(semimajor_axis, mass_earth, mass_moon)
print(f"The orbital period of the Moon around Earth is: {orbital_period_moon} seconds")
