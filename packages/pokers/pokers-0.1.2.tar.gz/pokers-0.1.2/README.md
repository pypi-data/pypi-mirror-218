# Pokers

Embarrassingly simple no limit texas holdem environment for RL.

## Why another poker environment?

Poker is a incredibly deep game with very simple rules, so why are all the environments so overly complex? Heck, someone could say that you need to publish a paper before building one (looking at you RLCard ðŸ‘€). Pokers way is to discard the agent environment cycle and all that stuff, just the good old new_state = state + action model. Through its simplicity pokers tries to be flexible and easily integrable into any framework.

### Why not to use pokers

Pokers is a side project inside another side project. This means that it is guaranteed to have bugs, which is not very nice for a RL environment. We have done our best to minimize the errors, testing it against the 10k hands pluribus logs. However, this doesn't cover some areas of the state space, so if you need a more reliable environment RLCard is a better option.

## Installation

Pokers can be installed directly from pypi.

```bash
pip install pokers
```

## Usage

Just create the initial state and act over it. Easy peasy.
```python
import pokers as pkrs

agents = [agent0, agent1, agent2, agent3, agent4, agent5] # Build the agents however you want
initial_state = pkrs.State.from_seed(n_players=len(agents), button=0, sb=0.5, bb=1.0, stake=100.0, seed=1234)
trace = [initial_state]

while not trace[-1].final_state:
    state = trace[-1]
    action = agents[state.current_player].choose_action(trace)
    new_state = state.apply_action(action)
    trace.append(new_state)
```

The initial state can also be declared with a fixed deck with `State.from_deck()`.

Curious about what info a state contains? Just go to [pokers.pyi](pokers.pyi) and see it yourself, I bet there's all you need.

As a bonus you can print the entire hand as text. Who wants GUIs anyway?
```python
print(pkrs.visualize_trace(trace))
```

### Error handling

There are two possible types of erroneous states: when an illegal action is performed and when a player bets more chips than he has available. These cases are represented by the enum `StateStatus` with the values `IllegalAction` and `HighBet`, the value `Ok` is used for correct states. This information is stored in the field `status` of the state so you can filter them.

Every erroneous state is also final. So applying an action over it will return the same exact state.


### Parallel actions

If you have a bunch of independent states and want to perform multiple actions in parallel you can easily trick the GIL with `parallel_apply_action()`.

```python
import pokers as pkrs

agents = [agent0, agent1, agent2, agent3, agent4, agent5]
states = [pkrs.State.from_seed(n_players=len(agents), button=0, sb=0.5, bb=1.0, stake=100.0, seed=seed) for seed in range(10)]

while not all([s.final_state for s in states]):
    actions = [agents[s.current_player].choose_action(s) for s in states]
    states = pkrs.parallel_apply_action(states, actions)
```

Since final states do not change when an action is performed, you can safely wait for all hands in the batch to end.

## Alternatives

To our knowledge these are some other poker environments that you would want to consider.

- [RLCard](https://github.com/datamllab/rlcard): Great RL environment for multiple card games.
- [neuron_poker](https://github.com/dickreuter/neuron_poker): OpenAI gym for texas holdem.
- [pgx](https://github.com/sotetsuk/pgx): Pretty cool project with jax-native game simulators. Sadly (at the moment) it doesn't implement NLTH.
