## TransCal: Transistor Analyzer

`transcal` package include so popular transistor configuration. 
It provides analysing transistors in `dc` and `ac` states.

### Features
I've seperated this project into three main part:

+ `BJTAnalysis` provide analysis of bjt type transistors.
+ `JFETAnalysis` provide analysis of jfet type transistors.
+ `MOSFETAnalysis` provide analysis of mosfet type transistors.

Also, there are some different methods for getting easy.

### Installation

+ `pip install transcal`
