=============
Xcode project
=============

Briefcase supports creating a full Xcode project for a macOS app. This project
can then be used to build an actual app bundle, with the ``briefcase build``
command or directly from Xcode.

By default, apps will be both signed and notarized when they are packaged.

The Xcode project will produce a ``.app`` bundle is a distributable artefact.
Alternatively, this ``.app`` bundle can be packaged as a ``.dmg`` that contains
the ``.app`` bundle. The default packaging format is ``.dmg``.

Icon format
===========

macOS Xcode projects use ``.png`` format icons. An application must provide icons of
the following sizes:

* 16px
* 32px
* 64px
* 128px
* 256px
* 512px
* 1024px

Splash Image format
===================

macOS Xcode projects do not support splash screens.

Additional options
==================

The following options can be provided at the command line when packaging
macOS apps.

``--no-notarize``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Do not submit the application for notarization. By default, apps will be
submitted for notarization unless they have been signed with an ad-hoc
signing identity.

Platform quirks
===============

Packaging with ``--adhoc-sign``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Using the ``--adhoc-sign`` option on macOS produces an app that will be able
to run on your own machine, but won't run on any other computer. In order to
distribute your app to other users, you will need to sign the app with a full
signing identity.
