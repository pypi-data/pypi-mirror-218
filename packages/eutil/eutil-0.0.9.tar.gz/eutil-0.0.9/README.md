# eutil - Extended Utility

Implements numerous functions and classes for reusable and modular use. 
Aims to implement commonly used design-patterns and algorithms in a pythonic
way to increase development speed.

Warning this is not most performant way to implement most things. Meant for 
quick development and later change implementation to more optimized method.
