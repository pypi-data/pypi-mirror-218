Description: Tryton FileStore S3 AWS Backend
        ===============================
        
        S3 AWS backend for the Tryton application framework.
        
        In order to configure the S3 Amazon you should modify your trytond
        configuration file to include the `tryton_filestore_s3.FileStoreS3` as class
        of the database section. Also you need to specify the s3 credentials
        with the s3_access_key, s3_secret_key and bucket values.
        
        An example configuration file looks like::
        
            [database]
            class=tryton_filestore_s3.FileStoreS3
            s3_access_key=access-key-s3
            s3_secret_key=secret-key-s3
            bucket=bucket-id-here
        
        Once you have specified the config file, everything should work out of the
        box and you should see your attachments created on the S3 bucket.
        
        You can configure a different endpoint URL than the one generated for Amazon
        with the configuration `s3_endpoint` (which must contain the scheme like
        `https://`).
