# sts-libs

Libs for testing storage drivers and userspace utilities on rpm-based operating systems.

## What is this?
The goal is to be able to rapidly write new tests with ease.

It started as an incompatible fork of [libsan](https://gitlab.com/rh-kernel-stqe/python-libsan)
and [stqe](https://gitlab.com/rh-kernel-stqe/python-libsan) with many changes. Most notably:
 - Python 3.8+ only.
 - Minimum dependencies.
 - With [tmt](https://github.com/teemtee/tmt)-compatibility in mind.
 - One repository for both libs and tests.

## Who is this for?
Fedora, CentOS, RHEL testers.

## How do I contribute?
See [contributing](https://gitlab.com/rh-kernel-stqe/sts/docs/contributing.md) doc.
