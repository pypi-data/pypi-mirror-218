                                              ABOUT NEW

— The code was rewritten from scratch to make it easier to read

— A vulnerability has been discovered in Adobe Firefly, you can upload images without a watermark!
  Check the element code and find the img tag with alt="Variation n of 4",
  follow the link in the src and upload the image with the PNG or JPG extension

Create URLs for images and text styles, for example:
create.image('Chocolate tree', ['hyper_realistic', 'cool_colors', 'studio_light'], 'portrait')
Create a great photo of a chocolate tree for your Instagram stories with very realistic graphics,
beautiful colors, and studio lighting.
Not interested in stories? Create something else! Example:
create.image('Sakura tree', ['cartoon', 'beautiful', 'pastel_colors', dramatic_light'], 'widescreen')
Creates a beautifully drawn picture of a sakura tree, in cartoon style, beautiful,
in pastel colors and with dramatic lighting,
with an aspect ratio that is ideal for desktop backgrounds

Already have the image you need? Edit it!

The code that will remove the background:
edit.backdrop('image.img', 'backdrop.img')
You can add a vignette like this:
edit.vignette('image.img', level)
Turn the image into a cartoon:
edit.cartoon('image.img')
