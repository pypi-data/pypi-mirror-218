Hi here!

Create URLs for images and text styles, for example:
create.image('Chocolate tree', ['hyper_realistic', 'cool_colors', 'studio_light'], 'portrait')
Create a great photo of a chocolate tree for your Instagram stories with very realistic graphics,
beautiful colors, and studio lighting.
Not interested in stories? Create something else! Example:
create.image('Sakura tree', ['cartoon', 'beautiful', 'pastel_colors', dramatic_light'], 'widescreen')
Creates a beautifully drawn picture of a sakura tree, in cartoon style, beautiful,
in pastel colors and with dramatic lighting,
with an aspect ratio that is ideal for desktop backgrounds

Already have the image you need? Edit it!

The code that will remove the background:
edit.backdrop('image.img', 'backdrop.img')
You can add a vignette like this:
edit.vignette('image.img', level)
Turn the image into a cartoon:
edit.cartoon('image.img')

Build any shape with lines and ellipses!

And much more...
