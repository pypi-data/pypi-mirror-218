    The objective of this algorithm is the following one: it computes an ordered partition of the elements to rank that
    is a list of sets L = [s1, s2, s3, ..., sk] such that for all i < j, for all x in s[i] and y in s[j], x is before y
    in all the optimal consensus rankings within a Kemeny prism. It is true for any ScoringScheme (see ScoringScheme
    class).
