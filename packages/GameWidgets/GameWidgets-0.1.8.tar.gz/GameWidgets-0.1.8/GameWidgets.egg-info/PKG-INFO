Check PyPi for download

Install

Mac

* pip3 install GameWidgets

Windows

* pip install GameWidgets

Since Last update, GameWidget's Colors.py has been turned into **Constants** and is now in the main directory
to install write ```from GameWidgets.Constants import *```

Also, the colors inside the Colors.py have been made part of a dictionary.

**Test in progress**

To use alignments, a test feature, there is a function in the Constants.py. Inside enter the screensize and the type of 
alignment. The alignments must be in order of y pos and x pos.

Example: 
```
# This code returns The center of the screen
# The first tuple tells the screen size
# The second tuple shows where in Y and then X
pos = Alignment((500,500),("Center","Center"))
#Returns Tuple in x,y format
```
**Warning**:

The returned value is the exact, GameWidget's items are meant to be placed at topleft.
When using, please change the position of the rect manually.
