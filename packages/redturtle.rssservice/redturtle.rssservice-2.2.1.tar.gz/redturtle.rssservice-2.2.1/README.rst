Redturtle RSS Service
=====================

This package add support to retrieve RSS feeds from external sources.

Usage
=====

---------

There is a service "**@rss_mixer_data**" that accept a block id, and return a list of sorted feeds by date.

This service only accept GET calls and accept following parameters:

- block: the id of the rssBlock with the feeds

The endpoint should be called on the context that has the rssBlock that you want to show.


For example::

    > curl -i -X GET http://localhost:8080/Plone/example-page/@rss_mixer_data?block=123456789 -H 'Accept: application/json' -H 'Content-Type: application/json'


Will reply with something like this::

    [
        {
            "source": "Foo site",
            "contentSnippet": "some description 2",
            "title": "Foo News 2",
            "date": "Thu, 1 Apr 2020 10:44:01 +0200",
            "url": "http://test.com/foo-news-2"
        },
        {
            "source": "",
            "contentSnippet": "some description 2",
            "title": "Bar News 2",
            "date": "Thu, 1 Apr 2020 10:44:01 +0200",
            "url": "http://test.com/bar-news-2"
        },
        {
            "source": "Foo site",
            "contentSnippet": "some description",
            "title": "Foo News 1",
            "date": "Thu, 2 Apr 2020 10:44:01 +0200",
            "url": "http://test.com/foo-news-1"
        },
        {
            "source": "",
            "contentSnippet": "some description",
            "title": "Bar News 1",
            "date": "Thu, 2 Apr 2020 10:44:01 +0200",
            "url": "http://test.com/bar-news-1"
        }
