    "Before we end this tutorial, there is one last thing we must do: create a lab team. A lab team is a set of lab members who own a set of NWB files and the associated information in our Datajoint database. Think of this as a \"subgroup\" within the lab that collaborates on the same projects. Only the members of a lab team will be able to delete table entries they made (this permission system is not yet implemented; we're working on it). Right now we need to set a lab team so that the permission for manual curation of spike sorted data can be set (this will be covered in [tutorial 2](2_curation.ipynb)).\n",
    "\n",
    "The `LabMember` table contains the list of lab members. It has a parts table called `LabMemberInfo`, where the Google account of each member can be found (for authentication purposes). Similarly, `LabTeam` table contains the list of lab teams and has a parts table called `LabTeamMember` which specifies which of the lab members (as entered in `LabMember`) belongs to each lab team. Both `LabMember` and `LabTeam` are `dj.Manual` tables, which means the data can be entered manually (although when we add our NWB file with `nd.insert_sessions(nwb_file_name)`, the owner of the NWB file (as specified in the `experimenter` field) is automatically entered into `LabMember` table). \n",
    "\n",
    "To proceed, we will create a new team using the `create_new_team` method of `LabTeam`. You will give this team a name, and add yourself (and your Google account) to this team. Later, when we do spike sorting, we will specify the team the sorting belongs to. This will give everyone in the team (in this case, just you) the permission to add curation labels."
