        Make sure to provide the right group where the handler was added in. You can use the return value of the
        :meth:`~pyrography.Client.add_handler` method, a tuple of *(handler, group)*, and pass it directly.

        Parameters:
            handler (``Handler``):
                The handler to be removed.

            group (``int``, *optional*):
