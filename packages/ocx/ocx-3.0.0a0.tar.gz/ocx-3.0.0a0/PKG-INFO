# The Open Class 3D Exchange (OCX) Schema

## Introduction 
This is the official GitHub repository for the Open Class 3D Exchange (OCX) schema (working draft version) owned and managed by the [OCX Consortium](https://3Docx.org).  
The latest published version of the OCX schema is available from the consortium's website.

## Changelog
  * [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md)

## Historic changes (pre 2.8.6)

  * [PRERELEASE_CHANGELOG.md](PRERELEASE_CHANGELOG.md)

## How to contribute
The schema file is maintained using an XML editor like Altova XMLSpy.
1. Installation: Simply download the schema files from the repository or clone it using git.
2. Create an [Issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-an-issue) for the proposed schema change. 
Follow [the recipe on the Wiki](https://github.com/OCXStandard/OCX_Schema/wiki) on how to register an issue.
3. Then create a branch from the issue, check out the branch and implement the proposed changes.
4. When the implementation is completed, create a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests).
4. The pull request will have to be approved by the [OCXStandard maintainer](https://github.com/orgs/OCXStandard/teams/ocx-schema-team?query=role%3Amaintainer) before it can be included in the working draft.


## Schema versioning
We are using [semantic versioning (semver)](https://semver.org/) to version the OCX schema. A published schema verison follows the semver pattern on the form X.Y.Z where X, Y, and Z are non-negative integers, and MUST NOT contain leading zeroes. 
X is the major version, Y is the minor version, and Z is the patch version. Each element MUST increase numerically. For instance: 1.9.0 -> 1.10.0 -> 1.11.0. 

A pre-release version is denoted by appending a hyphen and a pre-release identifier (alpha, beta ...) immediately following the patch version, for example: 3.0.0-alpha

If a pre-release tag needs to be patched, append a letter to the tag separated with an underscore, eg. 3.0.0-alpha_b.  Do not use ``.`` (dot) as separator.

## ``tbump`` versioning tool

The Python [``tbump``](https://pypi.org/project/tbump/) tool is used to automate and bump schema versions. tbump also provides the possibility for pre- and post-commit actions.
The project config file ``pyproject.toml`` contains the tbump settings.

### Usage

Assume that the current schema version is ``2.8.6``. To bump the schema version to the pre-release ``alpha`` version, the following command can be issued:

<pre><code>
> tbump 3.0.0-alpha
:: Bumping from 2.8.6 to 3.0.0-alpha
=> Would update current version in pyproject.toml
=> Would patch these files
- pyproject.toml:3 version = "2.8.6"
+ pyproject.toml:3 version = "3.0.0-alpha"
- pyproject.toml:34 current = "2.8.6"
+ pyproject.toml:34 current = "3.0.0-alpha"
- OCX_Schema.xsd:103 <xs:attribute name="schemaVersion" type="xs:string" use="required" fixed="2.8.6">
+ OCX_Schema.xsd:103 <xs:attribute name="schemaVersion" type="xs:string" use="required" fixed="3.0.0-alpha">
- OCX_Schema.xsd:12 xmlns:ocx="https://3docx.org/fileadmin//ocx_schema//V286//OCX_Schema.xsd"
+ OCX_Schema.xsd:12 xmlns:ocx="https://3docx.org/fileadmin//ocx_schema//V300alpha//OCX_Schema.xsd"
- OCX_Schema.xsd:14 targetNamespace="https://3docx.org/fileadmin//ocx_schema//V286//OCX_Schema.xsd"
+ OCX_Schema.xsd:14 targetNamespace="https://3docx.org/fileadmin//ocx_schema//V300alpha//OCX_Schema.xsd"
=> Would run these hooks before commit
* (1/4) $ python xsdata_package.py 3.0.0-alpha
* (2/4) $ xsdata generate OCX_Schema.xsd
* (3/4) $ gid add ./ocx_*
* (4/4) $ python insert_version.py 3.0.0-alpha
=> Would run these git commands
$ git add --update
$ git commit --message Bump to 3.0.0-alpha
$ git tag --annotate --message v3.0.0-alpha v3.0.0-alpha
$ git push --atomic origin working_draft v3.0.0-alpha
:: Looking good? (y/N)
