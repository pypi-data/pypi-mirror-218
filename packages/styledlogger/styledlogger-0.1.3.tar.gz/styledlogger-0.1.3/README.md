# StyledLogger

### A simple, yet beautiful logging library for Python 🐍 > 3.7

To use, simply install via `pip install styledlogger`

Then you can import the `StyledLogger` class from the `styledlogger` package, and initialize it with a name.

---

Simple example using a logger:

```py
>>> from styledlogger import StyledLogger

>>> logger = StyledLogger(name="Main") # Initialize a logger named "Main"
>>> logger.set_level(0) # Enable debug - default level is 1, which means every log type except debug. Setting the level to 0 enables the debug logs.

>>> logger.debug("This is just a test print")
10:13:30 :: DEBU @ Main - This is just a test print

>>> logger.error("Could not fetch url 'https://example.com'")
10:15:14 :: ERRO @ Main - Could not fetch url 'https://example.com'

>>> from styledlogger import StyleConfig

>>> logger.set_style(StyleConfig( text_format="%time% | %type% - %msg%", time_format='DD/MM/YYYY hh:mm' )) # Change the text format and time format in the logs. Placeholders you can use are: %name%, %time%, %type% and %msg%.

>>> logger.warn("CPU usage exceeding 90%")
22/04/2023 10:01 | WARN - CPU usage exceeding 90%
```

There's much more you can do with this library, and I encourage you to play around. Some features include file logging, custom callbacks and more.
