# Native extensions

This folder contains all C++ extension classes and functions. These extensions
are ordered in the way they will appear in the `pyvrp` package: everything in
this top-level folder will be made available in the top-level `pyvrp` package,
whereas for example everything in `cpp/search` will be present in 
`pyvrp.search` after installation (and so on for the other folders).

> When building on our implementation, please refrain from defining symbols 
> starting with the `PYVRP_` prefix. PyVRP reserves any such global declarations
> for internal use.

## Bindings

We use `pybind11` to generate Python bindings for the C++ codebase. These
bindings are generated from the `bindings.cpp` source files of each folder. 
Each `bindings.cpp` file is compiled into a single extension module named after
the installation folder, prefixed with an underscore.
