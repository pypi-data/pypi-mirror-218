        """
        Creates a SubPopulation instance.

        This subpopulation manages a collection of solutions, and initiates
        survivor selection (purging) when their number grows large. A
        subpopulation's solutions can be accessed via indexing and iteration.
        Each solution is stored as a tuple of type ``_Item``, which stores
        the solution itself, a fitness score (higher is worse), and a list
        of proximity values to the other solutions in the subpopulation.

        Parameters
        ----------
        diversity_op
            Operator to use to determine pairwise diversity between solutions.
        params
            Population parameters.
        """
    def add(self, solution: Solution, cost_evaluator: CostEvaluator) -> None:
        """
        Adds the given solution to the subpopulation. Survivor selection is
        automatically triggered when the population reaches its maximum size.

        Parameters
        ----------
        solution
            Solution to add to the subpopulation.
        cost_evaluator
            CostEvaluator to use to compute the cost.
        """
    def purge(self, cost_evaluator: CostEvaluator) -> None:
        """
        Performs survivor selection: solutions in the subpopulation are
        purged until the population is reduced to the ``min_pop_size``.
        Purging happens to duplicate solutions first, and then to solutions
        with high biased fitness.

        Parameters
        ----------
        cost_evaluator
            CostEvaluator to use to compute the cost.

    def update_fitness(self, cost_evaluator: CostEvaluator) -> None:
        """
        Updates the biased fitness scores of solutions in the subpopulation.
        This fitness depends on the quality of the solution (based on its cost)
        and the diversity w.r.t. to other solutions in the subpopulation.

        float
            The average distance/diversity of the wrapped solution.
