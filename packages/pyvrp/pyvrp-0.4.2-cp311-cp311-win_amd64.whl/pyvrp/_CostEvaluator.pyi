    Creates a CostEvaluator instance.

    This class contains time warp and load penalties, and can compute penalties
    for a given time warp and load.

    Parameters
    ----------
    capacity_penalty
        The penalty for each unit of excess load over the vehicle capacity.
    tw_penalty
        The penalty for each unit of time warp.

        Evaluates and returns the cost/objective of the given solution.
        Hand-waving some details, let :math:`x_{ij} \\in \\{ 0, 1 \\}` indicate
        if edge :math:`(i, j)` is used in the solution encoded by the given
        solution, and :math:`y_i \\in \\{ 0, 1 \\}` indicate if client
