class Client:
    """
    Simple data object storing all client data as (read-only) properties.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x
        Horizontal coordinate of this client, that is, the 'x' part of the
        client's (x, y) location tuple.
    y
        Vertical coordinate of this client, that is, the 'y' part of the
        client's (x, y) location tuple.
    demand
        The amount this client's demanding. Default 0.
    service_duration
        This client's service duration, that is, the amount of time we need to
        visit the client for. Service should start (but not necessarily end)
        within the [:py:attr:`~tw_early`, :py:attr:`~tw_late`] interval.
        Default 0.
    tw_early
        Earliest time at which we can visit this client. Default 0.
    tw_late
        Latest time at which we can visit this client. Default 0.
    release_time
        Earliest time at which this client is released, that is, the earliest
        time at which a vehicle may leave the depot to visit this client.
        Default 0.
    prize
        Prize collected by visiting this client. Default 0.
    required
        Whether this client must be part of a feasible solution. Default True.
