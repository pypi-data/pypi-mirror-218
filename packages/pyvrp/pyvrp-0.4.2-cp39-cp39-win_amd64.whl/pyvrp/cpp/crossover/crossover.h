/**
 * Performs two SREX crossovers of the given parents. SREX is a method that
 * selects a set of routes for each parent and replaces the selected routes of
 * the first parent with those of the second parent. The routes are selected by
 * minimizing the overlap between the two sets of routes. This is achieved
 * through a heuristic that iteratively shifts adjacent routes until no further
 * improvement in minimizing the overlap is observed. Then, two offspring are
 * generated by replacing the selected routes in two distinct ways, and the
 * offspring with the lowest cost is returned.
