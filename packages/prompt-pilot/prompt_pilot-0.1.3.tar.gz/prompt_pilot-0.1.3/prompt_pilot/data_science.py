1. Data Exploration: I can help you analyze the dataset to identify missing values, outliers, inconsistent formats, and other types of errors.

2. Missing Data Handling: I can guide you on different approaches for handling missing data, such as imputation techniques (mean, median, mode), deletion of rows or columns, or using advanced imputation methods.

3. Data Transformation: I can assist in transforming the data to address issues like inconsistent formatting, converting data types, handling outliers, and normalizing or scaling variables.

4. Data Validation: I can help you validate the data against predefined rules or constraints to identify data integrity issues.

5. Text Cleaning: If your dataset contains textual data, I can help you with tasks like removing special characters, standardizing text, correcting spelling mistakes, or performing text normalization.

6. Outlier Detection: I can provide guidance on identifying and handling outliers using statistical techniques or machine learning approaches.

7. Feature Engineering: I can help you create new features or derive meaningful information from existing features to improve the quality and usefulness of the dataset.
