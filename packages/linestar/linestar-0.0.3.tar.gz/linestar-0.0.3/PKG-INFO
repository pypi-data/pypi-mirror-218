# Linestar Python Client Library

This is the Linestar Python client library, which provides functionality for controlling the PLC Magnet Mover. The library allows you to connect to the PLC, wake up the system, move to the home position, go to a specific position, and retrieve location and error margin information.

## Installation

To use the Linestar Python client library, follow the steps below to install it using pip:

Create a new directory for your project:
```
mkdir my-project
cd my-project
```

Create a new Python virtual environment:
```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

Create a requirements.txt file and add the following line to it:
```
linestar
```

Install the required dependencies using pip:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You're now ready to use the Linestar library!

## Example Usage

Here's an example of how to use the Linestar library within a Python program:

```python
from linestar import PLCMagnetMover

def main():

    plc = PLCMagnetMover("192.168.1.100") # Replace with your PLC IP address

    # Connect to the PLC
    plc.connect()

    # Wake up the system
    plc.wake()
    print("System woke up successfully")

    # Move to the home position
    plc.move_to_home()
    print("Moved to home position successfully")

    # Go to a specific position
    plc.go_to_position(1.0, 2.5)
    print("Moved to position (1.0, 2.5) successfully")

    # Retrieve location information
    location = plc.report_location()
    print("Current location:", location)

    # Retrieve error margin information
    error_margin = plc.report_error_margin()
    print("Error margin:", error_margin)

    # Disconnect from the PLC
    plc.disconnect()

if name == "main":

    main()


```

Replace the IP address "192.168.1.100" with the actual IP address of your PLC.


## Updating & Distribution

Build the distribution package:

```
python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
```

Test the distribution package by installing it in a new virtual environment:

```
python -m venv test_env

source test_env/bin/activate  # For Linux/macOS

test_env\Scripts\activate  # For Windows

pip install dist/linestar-0.0.2.tar.gz
```

Upload your package to PyPI using Twine:

```
pip install twine

twine upload dist/*
```
