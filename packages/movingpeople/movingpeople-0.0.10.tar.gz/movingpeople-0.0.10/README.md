# movingpeople Python Package

movingpeople is a Python package for generating and visualising synthetic geospatial movement data within a network. 

Synthetic data consists of one or more routes, with optionality for defining combinations of fixed and randomised origin and destination locations, using OSMNX. Each route is defined by a unique ID and is composed of timestamped Shapely 'Point' geometries.

Visualisation of the resulting synthetic data uses keplerGL.
