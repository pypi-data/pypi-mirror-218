This `ngstents` package is a c++ extension of the
[NGSolve](https://ngsolve.org) finite element library, designed to ease
experimentation with solvers based on spacetime tents for hyperbolic
systems. The python front-end allows new equations (linear or
nonlinear conservation laws) and schemes to be easily defined using
their fluxes and numerical fluxes in a few lines of code.
