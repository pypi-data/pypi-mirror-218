CoBRA I/O
=========

CoBRA I/O is an interface to the `Composable Benchmark for Robotics Applications <https://cobra.cps.cit.tum.de>`_.
With it you can easily upload, download, and interact with CoBRA's robots, tasks and solutions.

Installation
------------

CoBRA I/O can easily be installed via pip::

    pip install cobra-io

If you want to develop CoBRA I/O, you can clone the repository and install it in editable mode and with developer dependencies::

    git clone https://gitlab.lrz.de/tum-cps/cobra-io.git
    cd cobra-io
    pip install -e .[dev]

Usage
-----

Examples on the usage of CoBRA I/O are provided in the `tutorials <tutorials/>`_ directory and a thorough documentation is available in `doc <doc/>`_.
The CoBRA benchmark suite elements are specified on the `documentation subpage of CoBRA <https://cobra.cps.cit.tum.de/crok-documentation/robot>`_.
The CoBRA API is documented `here <https://cobra.cps.cit.tum.de/api/>`_.
CoBRA I/O will generate a configuration file based on the provided `sample <src/cobra/utils/cobra.config.sample>`_; find the currently used with :code:`from cobra.utils.configurations import CONFIG_FILE`.

CoBRA I/O keeps a cached version of all files in CoBRA. To invalidate these caches run :code:`python -m cobra.utils.caches` and follow the instructions.
