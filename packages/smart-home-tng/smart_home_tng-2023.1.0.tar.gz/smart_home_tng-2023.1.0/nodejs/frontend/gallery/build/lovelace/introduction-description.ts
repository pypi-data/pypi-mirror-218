a different story about what is going on in their house. These cards
are very customizable, as no household is the same.</p>
<p>This gallery helps our developers and designers to see all the
different states that each card can be in.</p>
<p>Check <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/dashboards/">the Dashboards documentation</a> for instructions on how to get started with Dashboards.</p>
