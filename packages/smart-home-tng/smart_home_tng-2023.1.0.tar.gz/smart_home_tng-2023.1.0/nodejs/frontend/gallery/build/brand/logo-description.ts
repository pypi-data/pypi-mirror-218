<h2 id="using-the-right-variant">Using the right variant</h2>
<p>The pretty blue logo with a background shadow, pictured top left, is our primary logo. It should only be used with black, white, and non-duotone photography.</p>
<p>When needed you can use our logo without a shadow, as seen as the second variant. </p>
<p>The outlined logo should only be used on packaging.</p>
<h2 id="exclusion-zone">Exclusion zone</h2>
<p>The logo needs some personal space. It&#39;s exclusion zone is equal to a quarter the height of the icon.</p>
