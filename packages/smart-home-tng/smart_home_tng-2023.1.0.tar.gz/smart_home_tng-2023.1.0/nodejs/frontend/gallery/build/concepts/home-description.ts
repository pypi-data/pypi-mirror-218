<p>This portal aims to aid designers and developers on improving the Home Assistant interface. It consists of working code, resources and guidelines.</p>
<h2 id="home-assistant-interface">Home Assistant interface</h2>
<p>The Home Assistant frontend allows users to browse and control the state of their home, manage their automations and configure integrations. The frontend is designed as a mobile-first experience. It is a progressive web application and offers an app-like experience to our users. The Home Assistant frontend needs to be fast. But it also needs to work on a wide range of old devices.</p>
