                         'disjoint','touch','equal','overlap', 'contain',
                         'within'.
     stat                Wrapper function. Report basic statistics of genomic
                         regions, and calculate overlapping measurements,
                         including "C", "J", "SD", "SS", "PMI", "NPMI", without
                         bootstrap resampling or generating peakwise
                         measurements.
     zscore              Calculate Z-score of six overlapping measurements,
                         inlcuding "C", "J", "SD", "SS", "PMI", "NPMI". The aim
                         is to provide an overall measurement of the
                         collocation strength.

                         process to work properly, overlapped intervals in each
                         bed file must be merged. (default: 20)

   -o, --save            If set, will save peak-wise coefficients to files
                         ("input_A_peakwise_scores.tsv" and
