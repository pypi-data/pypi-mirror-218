Spatial Relation Of Genomic (SROG) intervals
============================================

Description
-------------
Match up two sets of genomic intervals, and report the code of Spatial Relation Of Genomic (SROG).
SROG codes include :code:`disjoint`, :code:`touch`, :code:`equal`, :code:`overlap`, :code:`contain`, :code:`within`.

Usage

:code:`cobind.py srog -h`

 usage: cobind.py srog [-h] [--dist MAX_DIST] [-l log_file] [-d]
                       input_A.bed input_B.bed output.tsv

 positional arguments:
   input_A.bed           Genomic regions in BED, BED-like or bigBed format. If
                         'name' (the 4th column) is not provided, the default
                         name is "chrom:start-end". If strand (the 6th column)
                         is not provided, the default strand is "+".
   input_B.bed           Genomic regions in BED, BED-like or bigBed format. If
                         'name' (the 4th column) is not provided, the default
                         name is "chrom:start-end". If strand (the 6th column)
                         is not provided, the default strand is "+".
   output.tsv            Generate spatial relation code (disjoint, touch,
                         equal, overlap, contain, within) for each genomic
                         interval in "input_A.bed".

 options:
   -h, --help            show this help message and exit
   --dist MAX_DIST       When intervals are disjoint, find the closest up- and
                         down-stream intervals that are no further than
                         `max_dist` away. default: 250000000)
   -l log_file, --log log_file
                         This file is used to save the log information. By
                         default, if no file is specified (None), the log
                         information will be printed to the screen.
   -d, --debug           Print detailed information for debugging.
