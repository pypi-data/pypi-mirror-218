 positional arguments:
   input_A.bed           Genomic regions in BED, BED-like or bigBed format. The
                         BED-like format includes:'bed3', 'bed4', 'bed6',
                         'bed12', 'bedgraph', 'narrowpeak', 'broadpeak',

                         text, compressed (.gz, .z, .bz, .bz2, .bzip2) or
                         remote (http://, https://, ftp://) files. Do not
                         compress BigBed foramt. BigBed file can also be a
                         remote file.
   input_B.bed           Genomic regions in BED, BED-like or bigBed format. The
                         BED-like format includes:'bed3', 'bed4', 'bed6',
                         'bed12', 'bedgraph', 'narrowpeak', 'broadpeak',
                         'gappedpeak'. BED and BED-like format can be plain

                         remote (http://, https://, ftp://) files. Do not
                         compress BigBed foramt. BigBed file can also be a
                         remote file.

 options:
   -h, --help            show this help message and exit
   --nameA NAMEA         Name to represent 1st set of genomic interval. If not
                         specified (None), the file name ("input_A.bed") will
                         be used.
   --nameB NAMEB         Name to represent the 2nd set of genomic interval. If
                         not specified (None), the file name ("input_B.bed")
                         will be used.
   -n ITER, --ndraws ITER
                         Times of resampling to estimate confidence intervals.
                         Set to '0' to turn off resampling. For the resampling
                         process to work properly, overlapped intervals in each
                         bed file must be merged. (default: 20)
   -f SUBSAMPLE, --fraction SUBSAMPLE
                         Resampling fraction. (default: 0.75)
   -b BGSIZE, --background BGSIZE
                         The size of the cis-regulatory genomic regions. This
                         is about 1.4Gb For the human genome. (default:
                         1400000000)
   -o, --save            If set, will save peak-wise coefficients to files
                         ("input_A_peakwise_scores.tsv" and
                         "input_B_peakwise_scores.tsv").
   -l log_file, --log log_file
                         This file is used to save the log information. By
                         default, if no file is specified (None), the log
                         information will be printed to the screen.
   -d, --debug           Print detailed information for debugging.

Example
-------

Calculate the **overall** collocation coefficient and **peak-wise** collocation coefficients between `CTCF binding sites <https://cobind.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dataset.html#ctcf-chip-seq>`_ and `RAD21 binding sites <https://cobind.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dataset.html#rad21-chip-seq>`_.

:code:`python3 ../bin/cobind.py overlap CTCF_ENCFF660GHM.bed RAD21_ENCFF057JFH.bed --save`

The overall collocation coefficient between :code:`CTCF_ENCFF660GHM.bed` and :code:`RAD21_ENCFF057JFH.bed` was printed to screen
