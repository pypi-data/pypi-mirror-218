Plotly opens a new tab in a browser each time it is used.  I am not sure how to fix this as searching for solutions for a while did not bring up any browser settings that could be modified.

Some PyQTGraph default commands (right click selections) do not work.  I have not removed these from the PyQTGraph source.

Have not tested this in Jupyter Notebooks.  I don't think it will work yet in Jupyter Notebooks but you can try.

The spectral trace success relies on a decent to good Gaussian fit in spatial direction at every ~20-50 columns, so this could fail entirely on spectra that are very out of focus and show double peaks.  I plan to fix this and make it more flexible in a future update.

When running epar_imXam.py, "Greys" is the only option for color map at the moment.  Will be changed in the future.

Note 1: the first time you use imXam, it will take longer than normal to start b/c it's creating
all those pycache/ folders.

Note 2: imXam requires vim, which is already installed on most systems that use UNIX (make sure that your
system has vim, not vi).
