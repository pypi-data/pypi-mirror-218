# ViennaRNA Package

A C code library and several stand-alone programs for the prediction and comparison of RNA secondary structures.

Amongst other things, our implementations allow you to:

- predict minimum free energy secondary structures
- calculate the partition function for the ensemble of structures
- compute various equilibrium probabilities
- calculate suboptimal structures in a given energy range
- compute local structures in long sequences
- predict consensus secondary structures from a multiple sequence alignment
- predict melting curves
- search for sequences folding into a given structure
- compare two secondary structures 
- predict interactions between multiple RNA molecules

The package includes `Perl 5` and `Python` modules that give access to almost
all functions of the C library from within the respective scripting languages.

There is also a set of programs for analyzing sequence and distance
data using split decomposition, statistical geometry, and cluster methods.
They are not maintained any more and not built by default.

The code very rarely uses static arrays, and all programs should work for 
sequences up to a length of 32,700 (if you have huge amounts of memory that
is).

See the [NEWS](NEWS) and [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) files for changes between versions.

----

## Availability

The most recent source code should always be available through the
[official ViennaRNA website](https://www.tbi.univie.ac.at/RNA) and through
[github](https://github.com/ViennaRNA/ViennaRNA).

----

## Documentation

Executable programs shipped with the ViennaRNA Package are documented by
corresponding man pages, use e.g.:
```
man RNAfold
```
in a UNIX terminal to obtain the documentation for the `RNAfold` program.
HTML translations of all man pages can be found at [our official homepage](https://www.tbi.univie.ac.at/RNA/documentation.html#programs).

We maintain a reference manual describing the `RNAlib` API that is automatically
generated with [doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/). The HTML version of this reference
manual is available [here](https://www.tbi.univie.ac.at/RNA/ViennaRNA/refman/).

In addition, the description of the `RNAlib` Python API can be found at
[Read the Docs](https://viennarna-python.readthedocs.io).

----

## Installation

For best portability the ViennaRNA package uses the GNU autoconf and automake
tools. The instructions below are for installing the ViennaRNA package from
source.

*See the file [INSTALL](INSTALL) for a more detailed description of the build
and installation process.*

### Quick Start

Usually you'll simply unpack the distribution tarball, configure and make:
```
tar -zxvf ViennaRNA-2.6.2.tar.gz
cd ViennaRNA-2.6.2
./configure
make
sudo make install
```

### User-dir Installation
If you do not have root privileges on your computer, you might want to install
the ViennaRNA Package to a location where you actually have write access to.
Use the `--prefix` option to set the installation prefix like so:
```
./configure --prefix=/home/username/ViennaRNA
make install
```

This will install everything into a new directory `ViennaRNA` directly into
the home directory of user `username`.

*Note, that the actual install destination paths are listed at the end
of the `./configure` output.*

### Install from git repository

If you attempt to build and install from our git repository, you need to
perform some additional steps __before__ actually running the `./configure`
script:

1. Unpack the `libsvm` archive to allow for SVM Z-score regression with the
   program `RNALfold`:
```
cd src
tar -xzf libsvm-3.31.tar.gz
cd ..
```

2. Unpack the `dlib` archive to allow for concentration dependency computations with the
   program `RNAmultifold`:
```
cd src
tar -xjf dlib-19.24.tar.bz2
cd ..
```

3. Install the additional maintainer tools `gengetopt`, `help2man`,`flex`,`xxd`,
   and `swig` if necessary. For instance, in RedHat based distributions, the
   following packages need to be installed:
    - `gengetopt` (to generate command line parameter parsers)
    - `help2man` (to generate the man pages) 
    - `yacc`, `flex` and `flex-devel` (to generate sources for RNAforester)
    - `vim-common` (for the `xxd` program)
    - `swig` (to generate the scripting language interfaces)
    - `liblapacke` (for `RNAxplorer`)
    - `liblapack`  (for `RNAxplorer`)
    - A fortran compiler, e.g. `gcc-gfortran` (for `RNAxplorer`)

4. Finally, run the autoconf/automake toolchain:
```
autoreconf -i
```

After that, you can compile and install the ViennaRNA Package as if obtained
from the distribution tarball.


### Binary packages
Binary packages for several Linux-based platforms, Microsoft Windows, and
Mac OS X are available at [our official website](https://www.tbi.univie.ac.at/RNA/#binary_packages).

### Bioconda
Installation is also possible through [bioconda](https://bioconda.github.io/).
After successfully setting up the bioconda channels
```
conda config --add channels defaults
conda config --add channels bioconda
conda config --add channels conda-forge
conda config --set channel_priority strict
```
you can install the [ViennaRNA Package](http://bioconda.github.io/recipes/viennarna/README.html)
through
```
conda install viennarna
```


### Python interface only
The Python 3 interface for the ViennaRNA Package library is
[available at PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/ViennaRNA/) and can
be installed independently using Python's `pip`:
```
python -m pip install viennarna
```

#### Building a Python 3 sdist or wheel package
Our source tree allows for building/installing the Python 3
interface separately. For that, we provide the necessary packaging
files `pyproject.toml`, `setup.cfg`, `setup.py` and `MANIFEST.in`.

These files are created by our `autoconf` toolchain after a run
of `./configure`. Particular default compile-time features may be
(de-)activated by setting the corresponding boolean flags in
`setup.cfg`. See below for additional steps when building the
Python interface from a clean git clone.

Running
```
python -m build
```
will then create a source distribution (`sdist`) and a binary
package (`wheel`) in the `dist/` directory. These files can be
easily installed via Python's `pip`.

#### Howto prepare the Python 3 sdist/wheel build from git repository
If you are about to create the Python interface from a fresh
clone of our git repository, you require additional steps after
running `./configure` as described above. In particular, some
autogenerated static files that are compiled into RNAlib must
be generated. To do so, run
```
cd src/ViennaRNA/static
make
cd ../../..
```

Additionally, if building the reference manual is not explicitly
turned off, the Python interface requires docstrings to be generated.
They are taken from the doxygen xml output which can be created by
```
cd doc
make refman-html
cd ..
```

Finally, the swig wrapper must be build using
```
cd interfaces/Python
make RNA/RNA.py
cd ../..
```

After these steps, the Python sdist and wheel packages can
be build as usual.

----

## Configuration

This release includes the `RNAforester`, `Kinfold`, `Kinwalker`, `RNAlocmin`,
and `RNAxplorer` programs, which can also be obtained as independent packages.
Running `./configure` in the ViennaRNA directory will configure these packages
as well.
However, for detailed information and compile time options, see the README and
INSTALL files in the respective subdirectories.

A comprehensive description of configure options is available at our
[reference manual](https://www.tbi.univie.ac.at/RNA/ViennaRNA/refman/install.html#configuration).

See also
```
./configure --help
```
for a complete list of all `./configure` options and important environment
variables.

A couple of useful utilities can be found in the src/Utils directory.

All executables read from stdin and write to stdout and use command line
switches rather than menus to be easily usable in pipes. For more detailed
information see the man pages. Perl utilities contain POD documentation
that can be read by typing e.g.
```
perldoc relplot.pl
```

Together with this version we also distribute the programs

  * `kinfold`,
  * `RNAforester`,
  * `RNAlocmin`,
  * `RNAxlorer`, and
  * `kinwalker`

See the README files in the respective sub-directories.

## Energy Parameters

### Default Parameters
Since version 2.0.0 the build-in energy parameters, also available as parameter
file [rna_turner2004.par](misc/rna_turner2004.par), are taken from:

- [D.H. Mathews et al. (2004)](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0401799101),
"Incorporating chemical modification constraints into a dynamic programming
algorithm for prediction of RNA secondary structure",
Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA: 101, pp 7287-7292

- [D.H. Turner et al. (2009)](https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkp892), 
"NNDB: The nearest neighbor parameter database
for predicting stability of nucleic acid secondary structure",
Nucleic Acids Research: 38, pp 280-282.

### Deprecated Parameters
For backward compatibility we also provide energy parameters from Turner et al.
1999 in the file [rna_turner1999.par](misc/rna_turner1999.par).

### Trained Parameters
A set of trained RNA energy parameters from Andronescou et al. 2007,
[rna_andronescou2007.par](misc/rna_andronescou2007.par), a set of RNA
energy parameters obtained by graft and grow genetic programming from Langdon
et al. 2018, [rna_langdon2018.par](misc/rna_langdon2018.par) are
also included.

### DNA Parameters
To predict secondary structures for DNA, we additionally include two DNA
parameter sets:
  * [dna_mathews1999.par](misc/dna_mathews1999.par) and
  * [dna_mathews2004.par](misc/dna_mathews2004.par).


### RNA Base Modifications
Since version 2.6.0 several programs received support to predict structures
for sequences with modified bases. The corresponding energy parameters are
incomplete and mostly restricted to base pair stacking. The ViennaRNA package
currently includes paraneter sets for
  * [inosine](misc/rna_mod_inosine_parameters.json)
  * [pseudouridine](misc/rna_mod_pseudouridine_parameters.json)
  * [m6A](misc/rna_mod_m6A_parameters.json)
  * [7DA](misc/rna_mod_7DA_parameters.json)
  * [purine (a.k.a. nebularine)](misc/rna_mod_purine_parameters.json)
  * [dihydrouridine](misc/rna_mod_dihydrouridine_parameters.json)

### Paramers Set Availability
Energy parameter files are mostly provided for use with our executable
programs. All parameter sets are compiled-in to our `RNAlib` C-library.
Thus, when building upon our library, either through C/C++ or the
scripting language interface, these data are available through dedicated
functions and as constant strings. See, e.g.
[here](https://www.tbi.univie.ac.at/RNA/ViennaRNA/refman/group__energy__parameters__rw.html)
and
[here](https://www.tbi.univie.ac.at/RNA/ViennaRNA/refman/group__modified__bases.html).
