This package provides a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) for vehicle trajectory prediction with uncertainties.
It builds up on the work of [Convolutional Social Pooling](https://github.com/nachiket92/conv-social-pooling).
It has been adapted to CommonRoad and extended by the ability of scene understanding and online learning.
