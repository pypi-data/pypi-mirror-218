    there are 2 possible states: question and hint, default is question
    Algorithm:
    1. load user by user id
    2. create new user in case he doesn't exist
    3. get student state, skill level and last answer result (right or wrong)
    4.
        4.1. If last state is question and last answer is wrong get user a hint
        4.2. If last state is question and last answer is right increase the skill_score and get new question
        4.3. If last state is hint and last answer is wrong decrease the skill_score and get user a new question
        4.4. If last state is hint and last answer is right leave the skill_score on the same level, but generate new question with same skill_score
    10. dump user
