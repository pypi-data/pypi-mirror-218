# Get contribution in a Git Repo

requires `python >= 3.10`

## Install
`pip install get-contribution`

## Usage
<br> `get-contribution`

Additionally, you can provide an *optional username* argument to yield the contribution of a specific user. <br> <br>
`get-contribution 'John Doe'` 

## Algorithms
The algorithm is very simple. It calculates the time spent in a repo based on the number of times people have pushed to it.

This time between "pushes" is the contribution time.

## Inspiration
This tool is not meant to be an *accurate* measure of contribution. Rather, it is meant to give people a rough sense of how much time they have spent on a project.
Folks who are applying to jobs might find this tool useful since it provides a useful **metric** to be put on resume.
