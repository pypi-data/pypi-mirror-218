# Cybotrade

This is the Client SDK for building an automated trading strategy on [`Cybotrade`](https://app.cybotrade.rs). The underlying libraries are written in Rust and this is a Python wrapper made possible through [`PyO3`](https://github.com/PyO3/pyo3).

## Documentation

There are currently two main features for this library: 

1. Fetching historical data, `Datahub`
2. Collecting live market data, `MarketCollector`

### Datahub

This is a Python class and you can use it as follow:

```python
# Get the Datahub's url from environment.
url = environ.get("DATAHUB_URL")

# Connect to Datahub.
datahub = await Datahub.connect(url)

# Fetch 1m candles for the past 10 minutes.
candles = await datahub.candle("BTC", "USDT", "1m", "bybit_linear", datetime.utcnow() - timedelta(minutes=10), datetime.utcnow())
```

Note that from the example above it is not guaranteed that you will get exactly 10 candles, you might be only getting 9 candles as the candle for the current minute is not closed yet.

## Development

The underlying Rust libraries are private and hence not everyone is able to build this on their local environment. Although it is not required but using `miniconda` or `virtualenv` to manage your local development environment is recommended.

To build this package, first install `maturin`:

```shell
pip install maturin
```

To build and test use `maturin develop`:

```shell
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
maturin develop && pytest
```

## Publishing

The package is meant to be published to PyPi and the `Dockerfile` uses an environment `manylinux2014` to cross-compile for various linux architecture. It can be done by running the `publish.sh` script.

```shell
PYPI_USERNAME=<username> PYPI_PASSWORD=<password> ./publish.sh
```
