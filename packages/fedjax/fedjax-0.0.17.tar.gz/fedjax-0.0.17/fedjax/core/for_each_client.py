  Args:
    client_init: Function that initializes the internal intermittent client step
      state from the share input and per client input. The shared input contains
      information like the global model parameters that are shared across all
      clients. The per client input is per client information. The initialized
      internal client step state is fed as intermittent input and output from
      `client_step` and `client_final`. This client step state usually contains
      the model parameters and optimizer state for each client that are updated
      at each `client_step`. This will be run once for each client.
    client_step: Function that takes the client step state and a batch of
      examples as input and outputs a (possibly updated) client step state.
      Optionally, per step results can also be returned as the second element if
      `with_step_result` is True. Per step results are usually diagnostics like
      gradient norm. This will be run for each batch for each client.
    client_final: Function that applies the final transformation on the internal
      client step state to the desired final client output. More meaningful
      transformations can be done here, like model update clipping. Defaults to
      just returning the client step state. This will be run once for each
      client.
    with_step_result: Indicates whether client_step returns a pair where the
      first element is considered the client output and the second element is
      the client step result.

  Returns:
    A for each client function that takes shared_input and the per client inputs
    as tuple (client_id, batched_client_data, client_rng) to map over and
    returns the outputs per client as specified in `client_final` along with
    optional per client per step results.
