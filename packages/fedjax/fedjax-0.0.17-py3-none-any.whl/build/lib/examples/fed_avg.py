"""Basic federated averaging implementation using fedjax.experimental.

This is the basic implementation in that sense that we write out the native
Python for loops over clients by hand. While this is much more straightforward
to implement, it's not the fastest. This is a good starting point for
implementing custom algorithms since it tends to follow pseudocode closely.
