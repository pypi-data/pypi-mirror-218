                XRDImage is a Python 3 package developed by the SDLE Research Center at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, OH.
                XRDImage contains functions required to preprocess, dark correct, and center XRD images. 
                It also consists of functions required to make XRD images temperature independent. 
                In v.0.0.4, we've added ring segmentation, ring clustering algorithms, and ellipse fitting algorithms.
                The user inputs the file path, and output folder, dark file path, and a reference image path, 
                and the output will be a folder full of images processed by our dark correction, centering, resizing, and temperature independence scripts.
