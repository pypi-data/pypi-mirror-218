XRDImage is a Python3 package developed by the SDLE Research Center at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland OH. 
            X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) is a technique used to identify and quantify crystalline phases in a material. By obtaining diffraction patterns, 
            XRD enables the identification of crystalline phases and orientation, determination of various structural properties such as lattice parameters, 
            stain, grain size, epitaxy, phase composition, and preferred orientation. Additionally, XRD facilitates measurements of thin film and multilayer 
            thickness, as well as the determination of atomic arrangement within the material. Notably, the analysis of diffraction patterns also allows for 
            the identification of internal stress and defects in crystals, providing valuable insights into material performance in different environments.

            Due to the nature of XRD Imaging techniques, most XRD images may not turn out perfect out of the lab. In XRDImage, 
            we have created an image processing pipeline, which contains dark correction, centering, temperature independence, and 
            registration scripts. In the latest release, we have also added ring segmentation, clustering, and ellipse fitting algorithms to
            obtain more information from the userâ€™s XRD images.
