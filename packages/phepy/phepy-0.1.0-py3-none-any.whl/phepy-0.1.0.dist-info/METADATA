              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

## Usage Example

The following code snippet only provides a minimal example to get started, please refer to the [`examples`](https://github.com/juntyr/phepy/tree/main/examples) folder to find more extensive examples.

```python
# Import numpy, matplotlib, and sklearn
import numpy as np
import sklearn

from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
from sklearn.neighbors import LocalOutlierFactor

# Import phepy, three toy examples, the out-of-distribution (OOD)
#  detector and scorer, and the plotting helper function
import phepy

from phepy.detector import OutOfDistributionDetector, PercentileScorer
from phepy.plot import plot_all_toy_examples
from phepy.toys import ToyExample
from phepy.toys.line import LineToyExample
from phepy.toys.circle import CircleToyExample
from phepy.toys.haystack import HaystackToyExample


# Generate three toy test cases
line = LineToyExample(np.random.default_rng(42))
circle = CircleToyExample(np.random.default_rng(42))
haystack = HaystackToyExample(np.random.default_rng(42))


# Use the Local Outlier Factor (LOF) [^1] as an OOD detector
class LocalOutlierFactorDetector(OutOfDistributionDetector):
    @staticmethod
    def low_score_is_low_confidence() -> bool:
        return True

    def fit(
        self, X_train: np.ndarray, Y_train: np.ndarray
    ):
        self.__X_lof = LocalOutlierFactor(novelty=True).fit(X_train)
        
        return self

    def predict(self, X_test: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
        return self.__X_lof.score_samples(X_test)


# Generate the plot for the LOF detector and the three test cases
fig = plot_all_toy_examples(
    scorers = {
        "Local Outlier Factor": PercentileScorer(LocalOutlierFactorDetector()),
    },
    toys = [line, circle, haystack],
    cmap = "coolwarm", # use e.g. "viridis" to be colour-blind safe
)

plt.show()
```

![By-example evaluation of Local Outlier Factor as a distance-based OOD detection method](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/juntyr/phepy/main/examples/minimal.png)

In the above figure, the single row showcases the Local Outlier Factor (LOF, [^1]) method, while the three columns contain the following three test cases:

* Two groups of training points are scattered along a line in the 2D feature space. The target variable only depends on the location along the line. In this example, points off the line are OOD.
* The training points are scattered around the sine-displaced boundary of a circle, but none are inside it. The target variable only depends on the location along the boundary. Again, points off the line are OOD.
* The training points are sampled from a 10-dimensional multivariate normal distribution, where one of the features is set to a constant. This example tests whether an OOD detection method can find a needle in a high-dimensional haystack, i.e. identify that points which do not share the constant are OOD.

The first two panels depict a subset of the training points using black `x` markers. Note that the first two plots do not have axis labels since the two axes map directly to the 2D feature space axes. The third plot differs and shows the *distribution* of confidence values on the y-axis for different x-axis values for the constant-in-training feature. The constant value is highlighted as a white line.

The Local Outlier Factor (LOF, [^1]) estimates the training data density around unseen data. Thus, it performs quite well on the line and circle examples where the data points are closely scattered. The LOF classifies the gap between the two groups of training inputs on the line as out-of-distribution (OOD), which may be too conservative if we assume that a machine-learning model can interpolate between the two groups. While LOF produces slightly lower confidence for the OOD inputs in the haystack, it does not clearly identify test data that do not have the constant feature seen in training as out-of-distribution.
