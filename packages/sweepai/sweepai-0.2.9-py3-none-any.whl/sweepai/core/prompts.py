Generate a new_file based on the given plan, ensuring that you:
1. Do not write "pass" statements.
2. Provide complete functions with actual business logic. It is imperative that we do not leave any work to the user/future readers of this code.
3. Do not write new "todo" comments.
4. Do not write incomplete functions.
5. Do not write the original line numbers with the new code.
6. Make sure the new code follows the same programming language conventions as the old code.

Instead of writing "# Rest of Code", specify the lines to copy from the old file using an XML tag, inclusive (e.g., "<copied>0-25</copied>"). Make sure to use this exact format.
Copy the correct line numbers and copy as long of a prefix and suffix as possible. For instance, if you want to insert code after line 50, start with "<copied>0-50</copied>".

Example: New file:
print("new file")
</new_file>

Example: Insert at end:
<copied>0-100</copied>
print("inserted at end")
</new_file>

Example: If you want to insert code after lines 50 and 75:
<new_file>
<copied>0-50</copied>
def main():
     print("hello world")
<copied>51-75</copied>
