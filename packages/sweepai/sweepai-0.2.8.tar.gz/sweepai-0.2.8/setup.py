You can plan out your changes with Sweep, and then Sweep can create a pull request for you. \n\n1. Install [Sweep GitHub app](https://github.com/apps/sweep-ai) to desired repos\n\n2. Run `pip install sweepai && sweep`. Note that you need python 3.10 or greater.\n\n3. This should spin up a GitHub auth flow in your browser. Copy-paste the 🔵 blue 8-digit code from your terminal into the page. Then wait a few seconds and it should spin up Sweep Chat. You should only need to do the auth once.\n\n4. Pick a repo from the dropdown at the top (the Github app must be installed on this repo). Then start chatting with Sweep Chat. Relevant searched files will show up on the right. Sweep Chat can make PRs if you ask it to create a PR. \n<img src="https://github.com/sweepai/sweep/blob/856ff66c2dbeaf39afbf6d8c49a620dfa70271fb/.assets/gradio-screenshot.png">\n\n💡 You can force dark mode by going to http://127.0.0.1:7861/?__theme=dark.\n\n#### From Source\nIf you want the nightly build and or if the latest build has issues.\n\n1. `git clone https://github.com/sweepai/sweep && poetry install`\n2. `python sweepai/app/cli.py`. Note that you need python 3.10 or greater.\n\n### ✨ Sweep Github App\nSetting up Sweep is as simple as adding the GitHub bot to a repo, then creating an issue for the bot to address.\n\n1. Add the [Sweep GitHub app](https://github.com/apps/sweep-ai) to desired repos\n2. Create new issue in repo, like "Sweep: Write tests"\n3. "👀" means it is taking a look, and it will generate the desired code\n4. "🚀" means the bot has finished its job and created a PR\n\n## 🤝 Contributing\n\nContributions are welcome and greatly appreciated! For detailed guidelines on how to contribute, please see the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) file. In essence, you\'ll need to fork the repository, create a new branch for your feature or bug fix, commit your changes, and open a pull request.\nFor more detailed docs, see [🚀 Quickstart](https://docs.sweep.dev/start).\n\n---\n\n## 📘 Story\n\nWe were frustrated by small tickets, like simple bug fixes, annoying refactors, and small features, each task requiring us to open our IDE to fix simple bugs. So, we decided to leverage the capabilities of ChatGPT to address this directly in GitHub.\n\nUnlike existing AI solutions, this can solve entire tickets and can be parallelized: developers can spin up 10 tickets and Sweep will address them all at once.\n\n## 📚 The Stack\n- GPT-4 32k 0613 (default) / Claude v1.3 100k\n- ActiveLoop DeepLake for Vector DB with MiniLM L12 as our embeddings model\n- Modal Labs for infra + deployment\n- Gradio for Sweep Chat\n\n## 🗺️ Roadmap\nWe\'re currently working on responding to linters and external search. For more, see [🗺️ Roadmap](https://docs.sweep.dev/roadmap).\n\n## ⭐ Star History\n\n[![Star History Chart](https://api.star-history.com/svg?repos=sweepai/sweep&type=Date)](https://star-history.com/#sweepai/sweep&Date)\n\nConsider starring us if you\'re using Sweep so more people hear about us!\n\n---\n\n<h2 align="center">\n    Contributors\n</h2>\n<p align="center">\n    Thank you for your contribution!\n</p>\n<p align="center">\n    <a href="https://github.com/sweepai/sweep/graphs/contributors">\n      <img src="https://contrib.rocks/image?repo=sweepai/sweep" />\n    </a>\n</p>\n<p align="center">\n    and, of course, Sweep!\n</p>\n\n',
