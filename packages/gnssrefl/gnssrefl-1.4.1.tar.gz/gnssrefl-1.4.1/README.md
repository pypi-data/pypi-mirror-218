<HR> 

GNSS-IR was developed with funding from NSF (ATM 0740515, EAR 0948957, AGS 0935725, EAR 1144221, AGS 1449554) and 
NASA (NNX12AK21G and NNX13AF43G). <code>gnssrefl</code> was initially developed 
as a fun post-retirement project, followed by support from NASA (80NSSC20K1731).

As of August 31, 2023, we will be an independent (unfunded) software package. Please help us maintain/improve this code.
