The wappstoiot module provide a simple python interface to [wappsto.com](https://wappsto.com/) for easy prototyping.


## Prerequisites

A [wappsto.com](https://wappsto.com/) Account, that the unit can connect to.

The wappsto module requires a set of certificates for authentication. The certificates can be downloaded from [wappsto.com](https://wappsto.com/), or with the build-in CLI tool: `python3 -m wappstoiot`.
The certificates provides the unit with the secure connection to wappsto.com.

To read more about how the Wappsto IoT inner workings, go [here](https://documentation.wappsto.com).

## The Basics

To understand how to use Wappsto IoT, there is some terms that need to be known.
* Control
    - Change request value.
* Report
    - The current value.
* Refresh
    - Value Update request.
* Delete
    - inform that a delete have happened.
* network -> device -> value
    - ...

## Getting Started


## Installation using pip

The wappsto module can be installed using PIP (Python Package Index) as follows:

```bash
$ pip install -U wappstoiot
```


Working examples of usage can be found in the [example folder](./example).

The needed certificates can be downloaded with: `python -m wappstoiot --path echo`
Where path is the path to the config-folder, given in the following code example.

There is also a Wapp avaliable called: [IoT Certificate Manager](https://wappsto.com/store/application/iot_certificate_manager) on wappsto,
that given you a GUI to do the same and more.

### Echo example

The following explains the example code found in [echo.py](./example/echo.py).


```python
wappstoiot.config(
    config_Folder="echo"
)
```

```python
network = wappstoiot.createNetwork(
    name="echo",
)
```

```python
device = network.createDevice(
    name="EchoDevice"
)
```

```python
value = device.createValue(
    name="Moeller",
    permission=wappstoiot.PermissionType.READWRITE,
    value_template=wappstoiot.ValueTemplate.STRING
)
```

```python
value.onControl(
    callback=lambda obj, new_value: obj.report(new_value)
)
```

```python
value.onRefresh(
    callback=lambda obj: obj.report(f"{obj.data} Refreshed!")
)
```

```python
try:
    while True:
        time.sleep(0.5)
except KeyboardInterrupt:
    pass
finally:
    wappstoiot.close()
```

v0.6.7 (Jul 07 2023)
===============================================================================
## Added
 * Scandinavian special letters to the legal list

## Changed
 * Updated the `wappstoiot.ValueTemplate` to version v0.0.5
 * Set Pydantic version to be `v1.10.11` until migration to `v2` is done.

v0.6.6 (Jun 22 2023)
===============================================================================
## Added
 * Code Stub.

## Changed
 * Now inform which characters are illegal in the given name.

## Fixed
 * The `getReportTimestamp` & `getControlTimestamp` now ensures the return is `None` or of type datetime.

v0.6.5 (Feb 28 2023)
===============================================================================
## Fixed
 * Report & Control now generate a timestamp in UTC time.

v0.6.4 (Feb 27 2023)
===============================================================================

## Added
 * onControlCancel
 * onReportCancel

## Fixed
 * Check on the argument count on callbacks on adding them.
 * Now the on-function returns the callback it was given.
 * Should now covert the timestamp correctly.
 * Fix an issue where it could not close the socket.

## Changed
 * Updated the `wappstoiot.ValueTemplate` to version 0.0.3

v0.6.3 (May 5 2022)
===============================================================================

## Fixed
 * Fixed a issue with the control method, there it broke if it got out of sink with the report.
 * `getReportData` now returns the Report data instead of control.
 * Fixed a issue that prevented in report/control values with old timestamps.

v0.6.2 (Mar 10 2022)
===============================================================================

## Fixed
 * Now `pathlib.Path` can also be used for the config config_folder input.
 * Fixed a issue where it always where asking for the value.
 * Fixed a issue where it did not create the need states, if the device existed. 
 * Fixed a issue where it will fail om the smallest schema change.

## Changed

 * Naming policy are now enforced. Have to be set, and may only contain:
    ALPHA/DIGIT/" . "/" ~ "/"(space)"/" - "/" _ "
 * Breaking Change! - Changes the 'ValueTypes' to 'ValueTemplates', which are a more meaningful name. The createValue input 'value_type', have also change to 'value_template'
 * Enforce the parameter-name for multiple inputs in the create-methods. 


v0.6.1 (Feb 21 2022)
===============================================================================

## Changed

 * Updated the ValueTypes to use the Default template values v0.0.1.


v0.6.0 (Jan 31 2022)

## Added
 * Ping-pong option in the config-method.
 * fast_send option in the config-method.

## Fixed

 * Fix some issues that only happen on first time run.
 * Fix a issue where if config was not called, the config-folder was not set to current folder.
 * Fix a issue where offline storage, did not allow the program to stop, if there was still data to be send.
 * Fix a issue with the way the certificates was created the right way, and is also claimed.

 * `permission` is now required.
 * `onControl`, `onReport`, `getControlData` & `getReportData` provides a float if the value was set to be a number.


## Fixed

 * offline_Storage warnings now fixed.
 * A issue where the `type`-value inside value where not set.
 * A issue where the step was set to a int, not a float.
 * `wappstoiot.onStatus` should not be working correctly.


v0.5.3 (Dec 9, 2021)
===============================================================================

## Added

 * Groove Examples for Raspberry Pi.
 * Checks of naming, so it reuses the object based on the name. (Naming are mandatory now.)
 * `wappstoiot.config` have been added to handle all the configs.
 * `wappstoiot.createNetwork` have been added to streamline the flow.
 * `value.getReportTimestamp()`, `value.getControlTimestamp()` have been added to make the timestamp for the last given value accessible.
 * `value.getControlData()` have been added to make the control data accessible.

## Removed

 * Remove the Module ids. (The Names are now the unique identifier.)
 * Remove `Rich` dependency.
