- :meth:`.ModNote.delete` to delete a single moderator note.

- Positional keyword arguments for applicable functions and methods. Starting with Async
  PRAW 8, most functions and methods will no longer support positional arguments. It

  alphabetically, and prevent breaking changes when adding new arguments to existing
  methods.

7.5.0 (2021/11/13)

**Added**

  helper classes.
- An import error when using Async PRAW in environments where ``libsqlite3-dev`` is
  needed to utilize ``aiosqlite`` package which depends on the ``sqlite3`` builtin.

  argument used to explicitly perform a fetch when initializing an object.

  for more info.

7.3.1 (2021/07/06)

  ``asyncprawcore.Session`` (more specifically, :py:class:`asyncio.AbstractEventLoop`)
  does not support being deepcopied.

**Fixed**

- Fixed an issue where some :class:`.RedditBase` objects would be sent in a request as
  ``"None"``.

7.3.0 (2021/06/18)
------------------

**Added**

- :class:`.UserSubreddit` for the ``subreddit`` attribute of :class:`.Redditor`.
- :meth:`.username_available` checks if a username is available.

  passed ``content`` and ``reason`` parameters that produced a request with a body
  greater than 500 KiB, even when the parameters did not exceed their respective
  permitted maximum lengths.
- Fixed bug where :meth:`.request` could not handle instances of ``BadRequest``\ s when
  the JSON data contained only the keys "reason" and "message".
- Fixed bug where :meth:`.request` could not handle instances of ``BadRequest``\ s when
  the response did not contain valid JSON data.
- Fixed bug where :meth:`~.FullnameMixin.fullname` sometimes returned the wrong
  fullname.

7.2.0 (2021/02/25)
------------------

**Added**

- :class:`.Reddit` keyword argument ``token_manager``.
- :class:`.FileTokenManager` and its parent abstract class :class:`.BaseTokenManager`.

**Deprecated**

- The configuration setting ``refresh_token`` is deprecated and its use will result in a
  :py:class:`DeprecationWarning`. This deprecation applies in all ways of setting
  configuration values, i.e., via ``praw.ini``, as a keyword argument when initializing
  an instance of :class:`.Reddit`, and via the ``PRAW_REFRESH_TOKEN`` environment
  variable. To be prepared for Async PRAW 8, use the new :class:`.Reddit` keyword
  argument ``token_manager``. See :ref:`refresh_token` in Async PRAW's documentation for
  an example.
- :meth:`.me` will no longer return ``None`` when called in :attr:`.read_only` mode
  starting in Async PRAW 8. A :py:class:`DeprecationWarning` will be issued. To switch
  forward to the Async PRAW 8 behavior set ``praw8_raise_exception_on_me=True`` in your
  ``asyncpraw.Reddit(...)`` call.

- Ability to specify subreddits by name using the `subreddits` parameter in
  :meth:`.Reddit.info`.
- Added :meth:`.Reddit.close` to close the requestor session.
- Ability to use :class:`.Reddit` as an asynchronous context manager that automatically
  closes the requestor session on exit.

**Changed**

- :class:`.BoundedSet` will now utilize a Last-Recently-Used (LRU) storing mechanism,
  which will change the order in which elements are removed from the set.
- Improved :meth:`~.Subreddit.submit_image` and :meth:`~.Subreddit.submit_video`
  performance in slow network environments by removing a race condition when
  establishing a websocket connection.
