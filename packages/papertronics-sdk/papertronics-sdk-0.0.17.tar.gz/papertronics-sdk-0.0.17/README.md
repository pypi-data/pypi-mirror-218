This **S**oftware **D**evelopment **K**it will provide external services, like [the Beer-O-Meter](https://testmybeer.com/), with message models and helper functions to use for communication with the LAB backend. This solves the problem of copied code by providing a central location for the message models. In addition to that, it would make it much easier and less error prone for third parties to write apps that integrate with the LAB backend, allowing faster adoption of the lab app into different markets.

This application is **Open Source** for anyone to use to integrate their software with our system. However, proper credentials are required in order to access the system.

## Design decisions
### Open source
The decision was made to go with open source to facilitate the development of integrations by third parties, and avoid code duplication as much as possible.
