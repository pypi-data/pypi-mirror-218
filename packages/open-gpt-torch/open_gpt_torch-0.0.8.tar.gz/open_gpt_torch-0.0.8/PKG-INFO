**OpenGPT** is an open-source _cloud-native_ large-scale **_multimodal models_** (LMMs) serving framework. 
It is designed to simplify the deployment and management of large language models, on a distributed cluster of GPUs.
We aim to make it a one-stop solution for a centralized and accessible place to gather techniques for optimizing large-scale multimodal models and make them easy to use for everyone.

## Features

OpenGPT provides the following features to make it easy to deploy and serve **large multi-modal models** (LMMs) at scale:

- Support for multi-modal models on top of large language models
- Scalable architecture for handling high traffic loads
- Optimized for low-latency inference
- Automatic model partitioning and distribution across multiple GPUs
- Centralized model management and monitoring
- REST API for easy integration with existing applications

## Updates

- **2023-05-12**: 🎉We have released the first version `v0.0.1` of OpenGPT. You can install it with `pip install open_gpt_torch`.

## Supported Models

<details>

OpenGPT supports the following models out of the box:

- LLM (Large Language Model)

  - [LLaMA](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/large-language-model-llama-meta-ai/): open and efficient foundation language models by Meta
  - [Pythia](https://github.com/EleutherAI/pythia): a collection of models developed to facilitate interpretability research by EleutherAI
  - [StableLM](https://github.com/Stability-AI/StableLM): series of large language models by Stability AI
  - [Vicuna](https://vicuna.lmsys.org/): a chat assistant fine-tuned from LLaMA on user-shared conversations by LMSYS

- LMM (Large Multi-modal Model)

  - [OpenFlamingo](https://github.com/mlfoundations/open_flamingo): an open source version of DeepMind's [Flamingo](https://www.deepmind.com/blog/tackling-multiple-tasks-with-a-single-visual-language-model) model
  - [MiniGPT-4](https://minigpt-4.github.io/): aligns a frozen visual encoder with a frozen LLM, Vicuna, using just one projection layer. 

For more details about the supported models, please see the [Model Zoo](./MODEL_ZOO.md).

## Roadmap

You can view our roadmap with features that are planned, started, and completed on the [Roadmap discussion](https://github.com/jina-ai/opengpt/discussions/categories/roadmap) category.

## Get Started

### Installation

Install the package with `pip`:

```bash
pip install open_gpt_torch
```

### Quickstart

```python
import open_gpt

model = open_gpt.create_model(
    'stabilityai/stablelm-tuned-alpha-3b', device='cuda', precision='fp16'
)

prompt = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."

output = model.generate(
    prompt,
    max_length=100,
    temperature=0.9,
    top_k=50,
    top_p=0.95,
    repetition_penalty=1.2,
    do_sample=True,
    num_return_sequences=1,
)
```

We use the [stabilityai/stablelm-tuned-alpha-3b](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stablelm-tuned-alpha-3b) as the open example model as it is relatively small and fast to download.

> **Warning**
> In the above example, we use `precision='fp16'` to reduce the memory usage and speed up the inference with some loss in accuracy on text generation tasks. 
> You can also use `precision='fp32'` instead as you like for better performance. 

> **Note**
> It usually takes a while (several minutes) for the first time to download and load the model into the memory.


In most cases of large model serving, the model cannot fit into a single GPU. To solve this problem, we also provide a `device_map` option (supported by `accecleate` package) to automatically partition the model and distribute it across multiple GPUs:

```python
model = open_gpt.create_model(
    'stabilityai/stablelm-tuned-alpha-3b', precision='fp16', device_map='balanced'
)
```

In the above example, `device_map="balanced"` evenly split the model on all available GPUs, making it possible for you to serve large models.

> **Note**
> The `device_map` option is supported by the [accelerate](https://github.com/huggingface/accelerate) package. 


See [examples on how to use opengpt with different models.](./examples) 🔥


## Build a model serving in one line

To do so, you can use the `serve` command:

```bash
opengpt serve stabilityai/stablelm-tuned-alpha-3b --precision fp16 --device_map balanced
```

💡 **Tip**: you can inspect the available options with `opengpt serve --help`.

This will start a gRPC and HTTP server listening on port `51000` and `52000` respectively. 
Once the server is ready, as shown below:
<details>
<summary>Click to expand</summary>
<img src="https://github.com/jina-ai/opengpt/blob/main/.github/images/serve_ready.png" width="600px">
</details>

You can then send requests to the server:

```python
import requests

prompt = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."

response = requests.post(
    "http://localhost:51000/generate",
    json={
        "prompt": prompt,
        "max_length": 100,
        "temperature": 0.9,
        "top_k": 50,
        "top_p": 0.95,
        "repetition_penalty": 1.2,
        "do_sample": True,
        "num_return_sequences": 1,
    },
)
```

What's more, we also provide a [Python client](https://github.com/jina-ai/inference-client/) (`inference-client`) for you to easily interact with the server:

```python
from open_gpt import Client

client = Client()

# connect to the model server
model = client.get_model(endpoint='grpc://0.0.0.0:51000')

prompt = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."

output = model.generate(
    prompt,
    max_length=100,
    temperature=0.9,
    top_k=50,
    top_p=0.95,
    repetition_penalty=1.2,
    do_sample=True,
    num_return_sequences=1,
)
```

💡 **Tip**: To display the list of available commands, please use the `list` command.

## Cloud-native deployment

You can also deploy the server to a cloud provider like Jina Cloud or AWS.
To do so, you can use `deploy` command:

### Jina Cloud

using predefined executor

```bash
opengpt deploy stabilityai/stablelm-tuned-alpha-3b --precision fp16 --device_map balanced --cloud jina --replicas 1
```

It will give you a HTTP url and a gRPC url by default:
```bash
https://{random-host-name}-http.wolf.jina.ai
grpcs://{random-host-name}-grpc.wolf.jina.ai
```


### AWS

TBD

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade

      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
