# InvestLib

InvestLib is a Python package for backtesting ETF investments. It allows you to create strategies, filter ETFs, and allocate capital based on your personal preferences within a rebalancing period.

## Flow
 1. Choose etfs
 2. Choose rebalancing timer (every month, every 3 month at a custom interval)
 3. Filter certain ETFs for the next period.
 4. Allocate the current budget based on your chosen allocation

### Rebalance
**MonthlyTimer** class allow you to set number of month to execute the rebalancing and on which day. Common possibilities includes **FirstFriday**. 
### Filters
Filters allow you to select a group of etfs in your list based on specific conditions, to create for example a momentum selection every month:
    - Percentage variation in month/days
    - Sharpe ratio (assuming risk-free rate as zero)
### Allocations
You can allocate percentages between the chosen ETFs using:
	- Fixed allocation
		- Statically
		- Dinamically based on the number of filtered ETFs
    - PctChangeRank
        Allow you to make a ranking on filtered ETF and allocate money based on your preference

## Data
The current unique data source is Tiingo. InvestLib automatically manages cash to avoid making repeated data calls. To use this feature, you need to create a free account on Tiingo and set the following environment variables:

- **tiingo_api_key**: the API token provided by Tiingo upon subscription
- **tiingo_backup_path**: the folder where you want to save the end-of-day CSV data for all the ETFs you need (default '/tmp/Tiingo'). 

# Installation 

I raccomand to use virtualenv:
    
    pip install investlib

## Example

Here's some code to test out some famous **portfolios**:

### 60/40 (60 stocks/40 bond)

    import os
    
    from investlib.strategy import Strategy
    from investlib.rebalance import FixedAllocation
    from investlib.rebalance import MonthlyTimer
    from investlib.rebalance import FirstFriday
    from investlib.report.draw import generate_report
    
    os.environ['tiingo_api_key'] = '<tiingo_api_key>'
    
    start = '2007-01-01'
    end = '2021-06-04'
    tickers = ['VTI', 'IEF']
    
    # We create a strategy that rebalances the current money (invested + cash) to 60% VTI and 40% IEF
    # every month on the first Friday.
    s = Strategy(
        tickers, 
        start=start, 
        end=end, 
        timer=MonthlyTimer(months=1, day=FirstFriday()),
        allocation_class=FixedAllocation({'VTI':0.6,'IEF':0.4})
    )
    s.run()
   
    generate_report(s, path='/tmp/6040.pdf', name='60/40')
    
### Futures 
    - Add more stats
    - Add more source of data
    - Currency
