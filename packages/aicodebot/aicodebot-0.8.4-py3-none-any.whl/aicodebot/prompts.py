    The commit message should:
    - Start with a short summary (<72 characters).
    - Follow with a blank line and detailed text, but only if necessary. If the summary is sufficient,
        then omit the detailed text.
    - Use imperative mood (e.g., "Add feature").
    - Be in GitHub-flavored markdown format.
    - Include contextually appropriate emojis (optional), but don't over do it.

    Start your response with the commit message. No prefix or introduction.
    Your entire response will be the commit message.
