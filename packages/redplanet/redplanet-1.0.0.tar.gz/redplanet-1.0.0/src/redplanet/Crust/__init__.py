RedPlanet module `Crust.py` allows you to access and plot high-resolution data for topography, moho, crustal thickness, and crustal density. The original data is defined in 0.1 degree bins (can be increased up to 0.0346, but this is not recommended), and we let you calculate values at exact coordinates by liniearly interpolating between the four nearest points.

NOTE: The first time you import this module, it can take a few seconds to download data (~70 MB). All subsequent loads will be much faster due to caching.

METHODS:
------------
>>> Crust.get(
            quantity: str, 
            lon: float, 
            lat: float
        ) -> float:

Get topography ('topo'), moho elevation ('moho'), crustal thickness ('thick'), or crustal density ('rho'/'density') at a specific coordinate. Units are km and kg/m^3.



>>> Crust.visualize(
            quantity: str, 
            lon_bounds: tuple = (-180,180), 
            lat_bounds: tuple = (-90,90),  
            grid_spacing: float = 1,
            colormap='',
            overlay=False,
            transparency_data=0.6,
            transparency_mola=0.9,
            figsize=(10,7)
        ):

Create a map of topography ('topo'), moho elevation ('moho'), crustal thickness ('thick'), or crustal density ('rho'/'density'). Model name is formatted f'{Reference_Interior_Model}-{insight_thickness}-{rho_south}-{rho_north}'.



>>> Crust.get_current_model(include_data=False) -> dict:

Get the current model parameters. Default is Khan2022-39-2900-2900 and grid spacing 0.1 degrees.



>>> Crust.load_model(
            RIM, 
            insight_thickness, 
            rho_north, 
            rho_south, 
            grid_spacing = -1, 
            suppress_model_error = False,
            suppress_grid_error = False,
        ) -> bool:

Load a moho and crustal thickness dataset based on the provided parameters. The data itself comes from a file of spherical harmonic coefficients which are downloaded/cached from a massive Google Drive folder.
        
A summary of all available models can be found here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZDILcSPdbXAFp60VfyC4xTZzdnAVhx_U/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=107564547097010500390&rtpof=true&sd=true, or by calling `Crust.peek_models()`. 



>>> Crust.load_topo(grid_spacing=0.1):

Loads a basic topography model. This is called automatically upon import, but can be called again if the user wants to change the grid spacing (not recommended). 

        

>>> Crust.get_model_name() -> str:

Get the name of the current model formatted '{Reference_Interior_Model}-{insight_thickness}-{rho_south}-{rho_north}'.



>>> Crust.peek_models():

Print a summary of all available models.
