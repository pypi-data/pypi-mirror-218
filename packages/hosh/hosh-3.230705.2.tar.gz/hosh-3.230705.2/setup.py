Also available as `identity` for people <br>or systems allergic to <br>utf-8 encoding.\n-------------------------|-------------------------\n\n![img_1.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/davips/hosh/main/examples/img_1.png) | Operations can be reverted by the inverse of the identifier.\n-------------------------|-------------------------\n\n![img_2.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/davips/hosh/main/examples/img_2.png) | Operations are associative. <br>They are order-sensitive by default, <br>in which case they are called _ordered_ ids.\n-------------------------|-------------------------\n\nHowever, order-insensitive (called _unordered_) and order-insensitive-among-themselves (called _hybrid_) identifiers are also available. | .\n-------------------------|-------------------------\n![img_3.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/davips/hosh/main/examples/img_3.png) | .\n\nThis is how they affect each other: | .\n-------------------------|-------------------------\n![img_4.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/davips/hosh/main/examples/img_4.png) | .\n\nThe chance of collision is determined by the number of possible identifiers of each type.\nSome versions are provided, e.g.: UT32.4, UT40.4 (default), UT64.4.\nThey can be easily implemented in other languages and are \nintended to be a specification on how to identify multi-valued objects and multi-step processes.\nUnordered ids use a very narrow range of the total number of identifiers.\nThis is not a problem as they are not very useful.\n\nOne use for unordered ids could be the embedding of authorship or other metadata into an object without worrying about the timing, since the resulting id will remain the same, no matter when the unordered id is operated with the id of the object under construction. | . \n-------------------------|-------------------------\n![img_5.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/davips/hosh/main/examples/img_5.png) | . \n\nConversely, hybrid ids are excelent to represent values in a data structure like a map, \nsince the order is not relevant when the consumer process looks up for keys, not indexes.\nConverselly, a chain of a data processing functions usually implies one step is dependent on the result of the previous step.\nThis makes ordered ids the perfect fit to identify functions (and also their composition, as a consequence).\n\n### Relationships can also be represented\nHere is another possible use. ORCIDs are managed unique identifiers for researchers.\nThey can be directly used as digests to create operable identifiers.\nWe recommend the use of 40 digits to allow operations with SHA-1 hashes. \nThey are common in version control repositories among other uses.\n![img_orcid.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/davips/hosh/main/examples/img_orcid.png)\n\nUnordered relationships are represented by hybrid ids.\nAutomatic transparent conversion between ORCID dashes by a hexdecimal character can be implemented in the future if needed.\n![img_orcid-comm.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/davips/hosh/main/examples/img_orcid-comm.png)\n\n## More info\nAside from the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.06028), [PyPI package](https://pypi.org/project/hosh) \nand [GitHub repository](https://github.com/davips/hosh), \none can find more information, at a higher level application perspective, \nin this presentation:\n![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/davips/hosh/14cb45b888eb8a18ae093d200075c1a8a7e9cacb/examples/capa-slides-gdocs.png)\nA lower level perspective is provided in the [API documentation](https://davips.github.io/hosh).\n\n## Python installation\n### from package\n```bash\n# Set up a virtualenv. \npython3 -m venv venv\nsource venv/bin/activate\n\n# Install from PyPI\npip install hosh\n```\n\n### from source\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/davips/hosh\ncd hosh\npoetry install\n```\n\n### Examples\nSome usage examples.\n\n**Basic operations**\n<details>\n<p>\n\n```python3\nfrom hosh import Hosh, ø  # ø is a shortcut for identity (AltGr+O in most keyboards)\n\n# Hoshes (operable hash-based elements) can be multiplied.\na = Hosh(content=b"Some large binary content...")\nb = Hosh(content=b"Some other binary content.
