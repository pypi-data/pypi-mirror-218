<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>This is a distribution of Python extension module for EPICS/CA
libarary. It allow you to access EPICS runtime database or CA server
through CA library. Now it support multi-threaded EPICS CA library in
Release 3.14 or later of EPICS.</p>
<p>Please read doc/InstallationMemo.html for installation proceduce.</p>

<p>A setup script of this module need to know the location of your EPICS
installation. Please EPICSROOT environment variable as the path where
your EPICS base is.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>download source package from PyPI site.</p></li>
<li><p>exapnd the file at appropriate directory</p></li>
<li><p>goto this directory and run</p>
<p>env EPICS_ROOT=/your/epics/root python3 setup.py build clean
install</p></li>
</ol>

<p>This module is updated so that it is now compatible with both
Python2.x (x&gt;6) and Python3.y. (I just tested with Python2.7 and
Python3.7).</p>
<p>This module also include calib module which is developed with Cython.
It is still under development. Once this module is completed, ca314.cpp
will be obsoleted and will be replaced by python module based on
calib.</p>

<p>_ca_kek.py and _ca314.cpp are tweaked to support "SyncGroup"
function.</p>
<p>_ca_kek.py is also clean-upped with 2to3 and pylint.</p>
<h3 id="memo2020.11.19">memo:2020.11.19</h3>
<p>A crash on centOS was caused by incorrect data conversion format in
PyArg_ParseTuple in _ca314.cpp. A size of data specified by the fromat
should be matched with the size of the correspondig argument. Functions,
sg_test/sg_reset/sg_state, were affected by this incorrect format
characters.</p>
<p>Most of python scripts in sample/ directory now works on both python2
and python3. I don't have PyQt, wxPython in the current test platform,
so scripts using PyQt or wxPython are not tested( but converted with
2to3 anyway). You may need to install future module (not __future__
module) into your python2 enviroment, to test sicripts using tkinter
module.</p>
