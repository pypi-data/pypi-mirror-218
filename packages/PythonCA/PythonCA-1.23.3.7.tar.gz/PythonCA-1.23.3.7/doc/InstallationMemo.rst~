#. You need Python 2.4 or later and EPICS 3.14.7 or later. (It may work
   with older version, but these are oldest versions I have built.)

   here <CaPython-1.10.tar.gz>`__\ [updated on 2007/05/03].
#.  Expand this tarball at  your working directory.
#. Open setup.py in your favourite editor and change some parametes,
   such as EPICS architechture and installation path, appropriately.

      EPICSROOT=os.path.join("your epics root path")

   ::

      EPICSBASE=os.path.join(EPICSROOT,"base")

   ::

      EPICSEXT=os.path.join(EPICSROOT,"extensions")

   ::

      HOSTARCH="your epics host architecture"

#. run the installation script, setup.py/  for build extension moules.

  the Python-CA callback routines. It will crash your running program
  immediately.
