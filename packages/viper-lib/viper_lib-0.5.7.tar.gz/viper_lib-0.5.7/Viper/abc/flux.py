    FluxOperators should handle a BytesReader and a BytesWriter, apply a flux operation from the input stream and write the result on the output stream.
    If the class attribute "inverse" is not None, it should be another subclass of FluxOperator that performs the inverse operation.
    If auto_close is True, then, when run() has finished its work, it should close the destination stream.
    When overloading the __init__ method, all additional arguments must have default values, as some programs may have to create instances of those objects by following the default interface.
    If some additional information is required, the initialize() method should take care of that.
