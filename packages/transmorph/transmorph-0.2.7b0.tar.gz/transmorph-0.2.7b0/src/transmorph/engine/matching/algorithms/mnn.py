class MNN(Matching, UsesCommonFeatures, UsesReference):
    """
    Mutual Nearest Neighbors (MNN) matching. Two samples xi and yj
    from batches X and Y are matched if xi belongs to the k-nearest neighbors
    (kNNs) of yj in X and vice-versa. All batches must be able to be
    embedded in the same space, at least pairwisely.

    We propose two solvers,

    - An exact solver, which computes all pairwise distances between
      batches, computes exact nearest neighbors and makes the intersection
    - An approximate solver, that leverages NNDescent algorithm to
      compute approximate nearest neighbors using projection trees.
      This allows MNN to scale to large, high dimensional datasets.

    Parameters
    ----------
    metric: str or Callable, default = "sqeuclidean"
        Scipy-compatible metric for kNN computation.

    metric_kwargs: dict, default = {}
        Additional metric parameters.

    n_neighbors: int, default = 10
        Number of neighbors to use between datasets before computing the
        intersection. The more samples, the higher this number must be
        to have a chance to get nonempty intersections. Using a subsampling
        algorithm greatly helps keeping this number of neighbors low.

    common_features_mode: Literal["pairwise", "total"], default = "pairwise"
        Uses pairwise common features, or total common features. Use "total"
        for a small number of datasets, and "pairwise" if the features
        intersection is too small. Ignored if datasets are not in feature
        space, set to "total" if solver = "pynndescent".

    solver: Literal["auto", "exact", "pynndescent"], default = "auto"
        Solver to use.
