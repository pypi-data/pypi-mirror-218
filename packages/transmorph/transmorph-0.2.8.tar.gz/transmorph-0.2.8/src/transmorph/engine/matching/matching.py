class Matching(ABC, IsProfilable, CanLog):
    """
    A Matching is an algorithm that is used to assess similarity between
    samples across datasets. Mergings use this information to build a
    common embedding between datasets. In our framework a matching between
    two datasets is represented as a sparse matrix whose value i,j represent
    matching strength between sample i from the first dataset and sample
    j from the second dataset.

    Every matching algorithm must inherit from the Matching class, and at
    least implement a fit() method. This method takes as input a list of
    matrices representing datasets to match, and returns a dictionary D
    where D[i, j] contains the sparse matching between datasets i and j.
    Access to other type of metadata can be granted by inheriting specific
    traits, and implementing their methods.
