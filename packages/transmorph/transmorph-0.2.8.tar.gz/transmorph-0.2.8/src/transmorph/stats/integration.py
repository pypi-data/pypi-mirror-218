    """
    Computes the distorsion of an embedding between two datasets
    with known ground truth matching between samples.
    Given a boolean matching where M[i, j] = 1 if xi <-> yj,
    matching_divergence(X, Y, M) =

        1 / sum_ij (M[i, j]) * sum_ij M[i, j]*d(xi, yj)

    This is a basic measure of quadratic divergence (see MDE for instance).

    Parameters
    ----------
    X1: np.ndarray (n, d)
        First dataset embedded in a d-dimensional vector space

    X2: np.ndarray (m, d)
        Second dataset embedded in a d-dimensional vector space

    matching: scipy.sparse.csr_matrix (n, m)
        Boolean matching matrix between X1 and X2.

    metric: str, default = "sqeuclidean"
        Metric string to use for the distorsion.

    metric_kwargs: dict, default = {}
        Additional metric parameters

    accelerated: bool, default = False
        Use a sparse implementation instead of scipy.cdist for much higher
        speed. If so, metric can only be those supported by sparse_cdist
        from Transmorph.utils.geometry.

    """
    Earth movers distance (EMD) between X1 and X2 measures how well both
    embeddings overlap each other. We use a POT backend here to compute
    this measure. The higher EMD is, the more expansive it is to make
    both datasets overlap (and then, the poorer the overlap is).

    Parameters
    ----------
    X1: np.ndarray
        Source dataset after integration

    X2: np.ndarray
        Reference dataset

    C: np.ndarray, optional
        Cost matrix between X1 and X2, if None then C is set to be
        the distance matrix between X1 and X2.

    metric: str = "squeuclidean"
        Metric to use if a distance matrix needs to be computed. It
        is passed as an argument to scipy.spatial.distance.cdist.

    metric_kwargs: dict, default = {}
        Additional metric parameters for cdist.

    per_point: bool, default = False
        If true, EMD per point is returned. Otherwise, the full cost
        is returned.

    max_iter: int, default = 1000000
        Number of iterations maximum for ot.lp.emd. Increase this
        number in case of convergence issues.
