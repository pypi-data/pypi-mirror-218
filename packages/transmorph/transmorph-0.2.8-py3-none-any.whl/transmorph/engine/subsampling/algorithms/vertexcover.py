class VertexCover(Subsampling):
    """
    Subsamples the dataset by computing a vertex cover, where every point
    in the dataset either belongs to the subsampling or is neighbor to a
    subsampled point (in the sense of neighborhood graph). We use a heuristic
    in O(n) that returns in worst case scenario a vertex cover twice as big
    as the smallest one.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n_hops: int, default = 1
        Maximal geodesic distance a point is allowed to be to the cover.

    n_neighbors: int, default = 5
        Number of neighbors to use to build the kNN-graph along which is
        computed the vertex cover. On average, a dataset with n samples
        will have a subsampled size of n / n_neighbors.
