    """
    Barycentric merging is the most naive way of merging datasets.
    Given n vectorized datasets X1, ..., Xk, a reference dataset Y,
    and n row-normalized matchings T1, ..., Tk from Xis to Y, the
    barycentric merging f of Xi to Y through Ti is given by

        bary_Y(Xi, Ti) = Ti @ Y

    In other terms, every sample from Xi is projected to the weighted sum
    of its matches in Y. This merging is limited to complete matchings,
    where all points from Xi are matched to at least one point in Y, as
    unmatched points are naturally projected to the origin. In this case,
    LinearCorrection can circumvent this issue to a certain extent.
