class GraphEmbedding(Merging):
    """
    This merging regroups different graph embedding methods (GEM). Given a
    graph of weighted edges between data samples, a GEM learns an embedding
    of samples which minimizes a cost depending on graph edges. We use as a
    representation graph a combination of matching graphs and internal kNN
    graphs. Several GEMs have been proposed, we included 2 in transmorph.

    - Uniform Manifold Approximation Projection (UMAP) [1] is a GEM which
      assumes samples to be uniformly distributed along their support
      manifold, and learns a local metric to approximate this hypothesis.
      It then simulates the graph in an embedding space, with edges
      acting as springs pulling or repelling samples depending to their
      estimated distance. We use the umap-learn implementation of UMAP.

    - Minimum Distorsion Embedding (MDE) [2] is a GEM which approaches the
      problem by trying to minimize distances between points with strong
      edges, while the embedding is constrained (in our case, it must be
      standardized). This creates an optimization problem yielding
      convincing embeddings. We ise the pymde implementation of MDE.

    Optimizers parameters can be edited in transmorph settings.

    Parameters
    ----------
    optimizer: Literal["umap", "mde"] = "umap"
        Graph embedding method to use

    n_neighbors: int = 10
        Number of neighbors to include in inner knn graphs.

    embedding_dimension: int, default = 2
        Target dimensionality of the embedding. For visualization
        purposes, choose 2 or 3. For feature learning, higher numbers
        like 20 or 50 can yield interesting results. It is recommended
        not to exceed initial dataset dimensionality.

    matching_strength: float = 10.0
        Edges weights between samples belonging to the same batch will
        be divided by this coefficient. Therefore, increasing it will
        tend to emphasize matching edges in the embedding representation.
        In the other hand, decreasing it will emphasize initial
        datasets geometry.

    include_inner_graphs: bool, default = True
        Adds edges of the kNN graph of each dataset in the final graph
        to embed. If false, only matching edges are embedded.

    symmetrize_edges: bool, default = True
        Symmetrize the graph to embed meaning if i matches j then j
        matches i. Recommended for stability, though less relevant
        with a high number of edges of good quality.
