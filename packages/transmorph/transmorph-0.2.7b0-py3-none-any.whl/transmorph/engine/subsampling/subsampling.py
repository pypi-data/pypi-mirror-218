    A subsampling scheme choses a subset of representers from a large collection
    of points. These representers are then used during heavy computational parts
    of the pipeline to speed up computations. SubsamplingABC is the abstraction
    that allows other parts of Transmorph to manipulate subsampling schemes.

    Parameters
    ----------
    str_type: str
        String representation of the matching algorithm. Will
        typically be the matching algorithm name.
