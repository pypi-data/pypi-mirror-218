class LISI(Checking):
    """
    LISI statistic measures how heterogeneous a sample neighborhood
    is for a certain label. Is is notably used in the Harmony [1]
    integration pipeline to measure how well integrated datasets
    are. Here, we use it to measure how many batches are found
    on average in each sample's neighborhood.

    Parameters
    ----------
    threshold: float, default = 0.5
        Minimum average heterogeneity to reach to accept
        an integration, after dividing by the number of
        datasets.

    perplexity: float, default = 30.0
        Scales the neighborhood size to consider.
