    """
    Computes a quality metric for a matching between two datasets whose
    point labels are known. For every point $x matched with $y1 .. $yn,
    its score is given by

    sum_{i=1..n} M(x, yi)*eq(x, yi) / sum_{i=1..n} M(x, yi)

    where M(x, yi) is the matching strength between x and yi, and
    eq(x, yi) = tp_cost if label(x) == label(yi), fp_cost otherwise.

    Then, edge accuracy is given as the average over all points of this
    score. A zero edge accuracy is interpreted as a matching decorrelated
    with labels, negative as an anticorrelated matching/labels and positive
    means matches are positively correlated with labels.

    A bad edge accuracy is associated with a high chance of poor integration
    quality, as matching edges are the skeleton of the final embedding.

        Cost associated to an edge matching two samples of the same class.
