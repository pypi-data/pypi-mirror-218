Welcome to Swarms - the future of AI, where we leverage the power of autonomous agents to create 'swarms' of Language Models (LLM) that work together, creating a dynamic and interactive AI system.

## Vision
Artificial Intelligence has grown at an exponential rate over the past decade. Yet, we are far from fully harnessing its potential. Today's AI operates in isolation, each working separately in their corner. But life doesn't work like that. The world doesn't work like that. Success isn't built in silos; it's built in teams.

Imagine a world where AI models work in unison. Where they can collaborate, interact, and pool their collective intelligence to achieve more than any single model could. This is the future we envision. But today, we lack a framework for AI to collaborate effectively, to form a true swarm of intelligent agents.


This is a difficult problem, one that has eluded solution. It requires sophisticated systems that can allow individual models to not just communicate but also understand each other, pool knowledge and resources, and create collective intelligence. This is the next frontier of AI.

But here at Swarms, we have a secret sauce. It's not just a technology or a breakthrough invention. It's a way of thinking - the philosophy of rapid iteration. With each cycle, we make massive progress. We experiment, we learn, and we grow. We have developed a pioneering framework that can enable AI models to work together as a swarm, combining their strengths to create richer, more powerful outputs.

We are uniquely positioned to take on this challenge with 1,500+ devoted researchers in Agora. We have assembled a team of world-class experts, experienced and driven, united by a shared vision. Our commitment to breaking barriers, pushing boundaries, and our belief in the power of collective intelligence makes us the best team to usher in this future to fundamentally advance our species, Humanity.

* Create a tool that creates other tools with access to write code, debug, and an architectural argent that creates the architecture and then another agent that creates the code[Architecter(with code examples), code generator (with access to writing code and terminalrools)] -- The Compiler?

* Create a screenshot tool that takes a screen shot and then passes it to a worker multi-modal agent for visual context.

* API endroute in FASTAPI

* Develop Conversational UI with Gradio

* Integrate omni agent as a worker tool

* Integrate Ocean Database as primary vectorstore

* Integrate visual agent

* Integrate quantized hf models as base models with langchain huggingface

1. **Multi-Agent Debate Integration**: Integrate multi-agent debate frameworks ([Multi Agent debate](https://github.com/Skytliang/Multi-Agents-Debate) and [Multi agent2 debate](https://github.com/composable-models/llm_multiagent_debate)) to improve decision-making.

2. **Meta Prompting Integration**: Include meta prompting across all worker agents to guide their actions.

3. **Swarms Class**: Create a main swarms class `swarms('Increase sales by 40$', workers=4)` for managing and coordinating multiple worker nodes.

4. **Integration of Additional Tools**: Integrate [Jarvis](https://github.com/microsoft/JARVIS) as worker nodes, add text to speech and text to script tools ([whisper x](https://github.com/kyegomez/youtubeURL-to-text)), and integrate Hugging Face agents and other external tools.

## Agent System Overview
In a LLM-powered autonomous agent system, LLM functions as the agent‚Äôs brain, complemented by several key components:

* Planning Subgoal and decomposition: The agent breaks down large tasks into smaller, manageable subgoals, enabling efficient handling of complex tasks.
Reflection and refinement: The agent can do self-criticism and self-reflection over past actions, learn from mistakes and refine them for future steps, thereby improving the quality of final results.

* Memory Short-term memory: I would consider all the in-context learning (See Prompt Engineering) as utilizing short-term memory of the model to learn.
Long-term memory: This provides the agent with the capability to retain and recall (infinite) information over extended periods, often by leveraging an external vector store and fast retrieval.

* Tool use
The agent learns to call external APIs for extra information that is missing from the model weights (often hard to change after pre-training), including current information, code execution capability, access to proprietary information sources and more.

* Communication -> How reliable and fast is the communication between each indivual agent.
