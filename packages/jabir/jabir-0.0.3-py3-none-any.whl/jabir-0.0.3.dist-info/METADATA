### jabir
We developed the Python package named **jabir** to generate atomic features. It can generate **322 atomic features for any type of material**, such as Electron Affinity, Electric Polarizability, Thermal Conductivity, Pettifor number, etc. Jabir calculates statistical relationships for each physical and chemical feature based on Element, Subscript, and Fraction.
