SOAP: Applying the Viterbi algorithm to search for sources
of continuous gravitational waves.

.. image:: https://git.ligo.org/joseph.bayley/soapcw/-/raw/master/pipeline/images/vitmap_ex.png

SOAP is primarily developed to search for continuous sources of
gravitational waves, however, has a more general application to search
for and long duration weak signal.

This package also includes tools to load in standard short Fourier transforms (SFTs) and prepare them for usage with the core SOAP search.
